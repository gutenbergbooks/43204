<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="noi"><i>Dear Boys</i>:</p>

<p>At last I am able to give you the third volume
of “The Motor Boys Series,” a line of books relating
the doings of several wide-awake lads on
wheels, in and around their homes and in foreign
lands.</p>

<p>The first volume of this series, called “The
Motor Boys,” told how Ned, Bob and Jerry became
the proud possessors of motor-cycles, and
won several races of importance, including one
which gave to them, something that they desired
with all their hearts, a big automobile touring car.</p>

<p>Having obtained the automobile, the lads were
not content until they arranged for a long trip to
the great West, as told in “The Motor Boys Overland.”
On the way they fell in with an old miner,
who held the secret concerning the location of a lost
gold mine, and it was for this mine that they
headed, beating out some rivals who were also their
bitter enemies.</p>

<p>While at the mine the boys, through a learned
professor, learned of a buried city in Mexico, said
to contain treasures of vast importance. Their
curiosity was fired, and they arranged to go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
Mexico in their touring car, and the present volume
tells how this trip was accomplished.</p>

<p>Being something of an automobile enthusiast myself,
it has pleased me greatly to write this story,
and I hope the boys will like “The Motor Boys in
Mexico” fully as well as they appeared to enjoy
“The Motor Boys” and “The Motor Boys Overland.”</p>

<h1>THE MOTOR BOYS IN MEXICO.</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br />
<small>THE PROFESSOR IN TROUBLE.</small></h2>


<p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”</p>

<p>It was the sound of a big revolver being fired
rapidly.</p>

<p>“Hi, there! Who you shootin’ at?” yelled a
voice.</p>

<p>Miners ran from rude shacks and huts to see
what the trouble was. Down the valley, in front
of a log cabin, there was a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>“Who’s killed? What’s the matter? Is it a
fight?” were questions the men asked rapidly of
each other. Down by the cabin whence the shots
sounded, and where the white vapor was rolling
away, a Chinaman was observed dancing about on
one foot, holding the other in his hands.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked a tall, bronzed youth, coming
from his cabin near the shaft of a mine on top
of a small hill. “Cowboys shooting the town up?”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s only a case of a Chinaman fooling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
with a gun, Jerry. Shall I run down and take a
look?” asked a fat, jolly, good-natured-looking lad.</p>

<p>“Might as well, Chunky,” said the other. “Then
come back and tell Ned and me. My, but it’s
warm!”</p>

<p>The stout youth, whom his companion had called
Chunky, in reference to his stoutness, hurried down
toward the cabin, about which a number of the
miners were gathering. In a little while he returned.</p>

<p>“That was it,” he said. “Dan Beard’s Chinese
cook got hold of a revolver and wanted to see how
it worked. He found out.”</p>

<p>“Is he much hurt?” asked a third youth, who
had joined the one addressed as Jerry, in the cabin
door.</p>

<p>“One bullet hit his big toe, but he’s more scared
than injured. He yelled as if he was killed, Ned.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that’s all the excitement, I’m going in
and finish the letter I was writing to the folks at
home,” remarked Jerry. The other lads entered
the cabin with him, and soon all three were busy
writing or reading notes, for one mail had come in
and another was shortly to leave the mining camp.</p>

<p>It was a bright day, early in November, though
the air was as hot as if it was mid-summer, for the
valley, which contained the gold diggings, was located
in the southern part of Arizona, and the sun
fairly burned as it blazed down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The three boys, who had gone back into their
cabin when the excitement following the accidental
shooting of the Chinaman had died away, were
Jerry Hopkins, Bob Baker and Ned Slade. Bob
was the son of Andrew Baker, a wealthy banker;
Ned’s father was a well-to-do merchant, and Jerry
was the son of a widow, Julia Hopkins. All of
the boys lived in Cresville, Mass., a town not far
from Boston.</p>

<p>The three boys had been chums through thick
and thin for as many years as they could remember.
A strange combination of circumstances had
brought them to Arizona, where, in company with
Jim Nestor, an old western miner, they had discovered
a rich gold mine that had been lost for
many years.</p>

<p>“There, my letter’s finished,” announced Jerry,
about half an hour after the incident of the shooting.</p>

<p>“I had mine done an hour ago,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Let’s run into town in the auto and mail them.
We need some supplies, anyhow,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“All right,” assented the others.</p>

<p>The three boys went to the shed where their
touring car, a big, red machine in which they had
come West, was stored. Ned cranked up, and with
a rattle, rumble and bang of the exhaust, the car
started off, carrying the three lads to Rockyford, a
town about ten miles from the gold diggings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder if we’ll ever see Noddy Nixon or Jack
Pender again?” asked Bob, when the auto had covered
about three miles.</p>

<p>“And you might as well say Bill Berry and Tom
Dalsett,” put in Jerry. “They all got away together.
I don’t believe in looking on the dark side
of things, but I’m afraid we’ll have trouble yet
with that quartette.”</p>

<p>“They certainly got away in great shape,” said
Bob. “I’ll give Noddy credit for that, if he is a
mean bully.”</p>

<p>Noddy Nixon was an old enemy of the three
chums. As has been told in the story of “The
Motor Boys,” the first book of this series, Jerry,
Ned and Bob, when at home in Massachusetts, had
motor-cycles and used to go on long trips together,
on several of which they met Noddy Nixon, Jack
Pender and Bill Berry, a town ne’er-do-well, with
no very pleasant results. The boys had been able
to secure their motor-cycles through winning prizes
at a bicycle race, in which Noddy was beaten. This
made him more than ever an enemy of the Motor
Boys.</p>

<p>The latter, after having many adventures on
their small machines, entered a motor-cycle race.
In this they were again successful, defeating some
crack riders, and the prize this time was a big, red
touring automobile, the same they were now using.</p>

<p>Once they had an auto they decided on a trip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
across the continent, and their doings on that journey
are recorded in the second book of this series,
entitled “The Motor Boys Overland.”</p>

<p>It was while out riding in their auto in Cresville
one evening that they came across a wounded miner
in a hut. He turned out to be Jim Nestor, who
knew the secret of a lost mine in Arizona. While
sick in the hut, Nestor was robbed of some gold
he carried in a belt. Jack Pender was the thief,
and got away, although the Motor Boys chased
him.</p>

<p>With Nestor as a guide, the boys set out to find
the lost mine. On the way they had many adventures
with wild cowboys and stampeded cattle,
while once the auto caught fire.</p>

<p>They made the acquaintance, on the prairies, of
Professor Uriah Snodgrass, a collector of bugs,
stones and all sorts of material for college museums,
for he was a naturalist. They succeeded in
rescuing the professor from a mob of cowboys,
who, under the impression that the naturalist had
stolen one of their horses, were about to hang him.
The professor went with the boys and Nestor to
the mine, and was still with them.</p>

<p>The gold claim was not easily won. Noddy
Nixon, Pender, Berry and one Pud Stoneham, a
gambler, aided by Tom Dalsett, who used to work
for Nestor, attacked the Motor Boys and their
friends and tried to get the mine away from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>However, Jerry and his friends won out, the
sheriff arrested Stoneham for several crimes committed,
and the others fled in Noddy’s auto, which
he had stolen from his father, for Noddy had left
home because it was discovered that he had robbed
the Cresville iron mill of one thousand dollars,
which crime Jerry and his two chums had discovered
and fastened on the bully.</p>

<p>So it was no small wonder, after all the trouble
Noddy and his gang had caused, that Jerry felt
he and his friends might hear more of their unpleasant
acquaintances. Noddy, Jerry knew, was not
one to give up an object easily.</p>

<p>In due time town was reached, the letters were
mailed, and the supplies purchased. Then the auto
was headed back toward camp. About five
miles from the gold diggings, Ned, who sat
on the front seat with Bob, who was steering,
called out:</p>

<p>“Hark! Don’t you hear some one shouting?”</p>

<p>Bob shut off the power and, in the silence which
ensued, the boys heard a faint call.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! Help!”</p>

<p>“It’s over to the left,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“No; it’s to the right, up on top of that hill,”
announced Jerry.</p>

<p>They all listened intently, and it was evident
that Jerry was correct. The cries could be heard a
little more plainly now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“Help! Hurry up and help!” called the voice.
“I’m down in a hole!”</p>

<p>The boys jumped from the auto and ran to the
top of the hill. At the summit they found an
abandoned mine shaft. Leaning over this they
heard groans issuing from it, and more cries for
aid.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Professor Uriah Snodgrass, A. M., Ph.D.,
F. R. G. S., B. A. and A. B. H.”</p>

<p>“Our old friend, the professor!” exclaimed Ned.
“How did you ever get there?” he called down
the shaft.</p>

<p>“Never mind how I got here, my dear young
friend,” expostulated the professor, “but please be
so kind as to help me out. I came down a ladder,
but the wood was rotten, and when I tried to climb
out, the rungs broke. Have you a rope?”</p>

<p>“Run back to the machine and get one,” said
Jerry to Bob. “We’ll have to pull him up, just as
we did the day he fell over the cliff.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Bob came back with the rope.
A noose was made in one end and this was lowered
to the professor.</p>

<p>“Put it around your chest, under your arms, and
we will haul you up,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“I can’t!” cried the professor.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Can’t use my hands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are your arms broken?” asked the boy, afraid
lest his friend had met with an injury.</p>

<p>“No, my dear young friend, my arms are not
broken. I am not hurt at all.”</p>

<p>“Then, why can’t you put the rope under your
arms?”</p>

<p>“Because I have a very rare specimen of a big,
red lizard in one hand, and a strange kind of a bat
in the other. They are both alive, and if I let
them go to fix the rope they’ll get away, and they’re
worth five hundred dollars each. I’d rather stay
here all my life than lose these specimens.”</p>

<p>“How will we ever get him up?” asked Bob.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />
<small>THE PROFESSOR’S STORY.</small></h2>


<p>For a little while it did seem like a hard proposition.
The professor could not, or rather would
not, aid himself. Once the rope was around him
it would be an easy matter for the boys to haul him
out of the hole.</p>

<p>“If we could lasso him it would be the proper
thing,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“I have it!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>He began pulling up the rope from where it
dangled down into the abandoned shaft.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you,” replied Ned, adjusting the rope
around his chest, under his arms. “Now if you
two will lower me into the hole I’ll fasten this cable
on the professor and you can haul him up. Then
you can yank me out, and it will be killing two
birds with one stone.”</p>

<p>“More like hanging two people with one rope,”
laughed Bob.</p>

<p>But Ned’s plan was voted a good one. Jerry
and Bob lowered him carefully down the shaft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
until the slacking of the rope told that he was at
the bottom. In a little while they heard a shout:</p>

<p>“Haul away!”</p>

<p>It was quite a pull for the two boys, for, though
the professor was a small man, he was no lightweight.
Hand over hand the cable was hauled
until, at last, the shining bald head of the naturalist
was observed emerging from the black hole of
the abandoned mine.</p>

<p>“Easy, easy, boys!” he cautioned, as soon as his
chin was above the surface. “I’ve got two rare
specimens with me, and I don’t want them
harmed.”</p>

<p>When Jerry and Bob had pulled Professor Snodgrass
up as far as possible, by means of the rope,
the naturalist rested his elbows on the edge of the
shaft and wiggled the rest of the way out by his
own efforts. In one hand was a big lizard, struggling
to escape, and in the other was a large bat,
flapping its uncanny wings.</p>

<p>“Ah, I have you safe, my beauties!” exclaimed
the collector. “You can’t get away from me now!”
He placed the reptile and bat in his green specimen-box,
which was on the ground a short distance
away, his face beaming with pride over his achievement,
though in queer contrast to his disordered
appearance, for he had fallen in the mud of the
mine, his clothes were all dirt, his hat was gone
and he looked as ruffled as a wet hen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Much obliged to you, boys,” he said, coming
over to Bob and Jerry. “I might have stayed there
forever if you hadn’t come along. Seems as though
I am always getting into trouble. Do you remember
the day I fell over the cliff with Broswick and
Nestor, and you pulled us up with the auto?”</p>

<p>“I would say we did,” replied Jerry. “But now
we must pull Ned up.”</p>

<p>Once more the rope was lowered down the shaft
and in a few minutes Ned was hauled up safely.</p>

<p>“It’s almost as deep as our mine shaft,” he said,
as he brushed the dirt from his clothes, “but I
didn’t see any gold there, for it’s as dark as a
pocket. How did you come to go down, professor?”</p>

<p>“I suspected I might get some specimens in such
a place,” replied the naturalist, “so I just went
down, and I had excellent luck, most excellent!”</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing you think so,” put in Jerry.
“Most people would call it bad to get caught at
the bottom of a mine shaft.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t so bad,” went on the professor,
casting his eyes over the ground in search of any
stray specimens of snakes or bugs. “I had my
candle with me until I lost it, just after I caught the
lizard and bat. I could have come up all right if
the ladder hadn’t broken. It was quite a hole, for
a fact. It reminds me of another big hole I once
heard about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“What hole is that?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s quite a story, all about mysteries,
buried cities and all that.”</p>

<p>“Tell us about it,” suggested Jerry.</p>

<p>“To-night, maybe,” answered the naturalist. “I
want to get back to camp now and attend to my
specimens.”</p>

<p>The boys and the professor, the latter carrying
his box of curiosities, were soon in the auto and
speeding back to the gold mine.</p>

<p>That night, sitting around the camp-fire, which
blazed cheerfully, the boys asked Professor Snodgrass
to tell them the story he had hinted at when
they hauled him from the mine shaft.</p>

<p>“Let me listen, too,” said Jim Nestor, filling his
pipe and stretching out on the grass.</p>

<p>Then, in the silence of the early night, broken
only by the crackle of the flames and the distantly
heard hoot of owls or howl of foxes, the naturalist
told what he knew of a buried city of ancient
Mexico.</p>

<p>“It was some years ago,” he began, “that a
friend of mine, a young college professor, was
traveling in Mexico. He visited all the big places
and then, getting tired of seeing the things that
travelers usually see, he struck out into the wilds,
accompanied only by an old Mexican guide.</p>

<p>“He traveled for nearly a week, getting farther
and farther away from civilization, until one night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
he found himself on a big level plain, at the extreme
end of which there was a curiously shaped
mountain.</p>

<p>“He proposed to his guide that they camp for
the night and proceed to the mountain the next
day. The guide assented, but he acted so queerly
that my friend wondered what the matter was. He
questioned his companion, but all he could get out
of him was that the mountain was considered a
sort of unlucky place, and no one went there who
could avoid it.</p>

<p>“This made my friend all the more anxious to
see what might be there, and he announced his intention
of making the journey in the morning. He
did so, but he had to go alone, for, during the
night, his guide deserted him.”</p>

<p>“And what did he find at the mountain?” asked
Bob. “A gold mine?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” replied the professor.</p>

<p>“Maybe it was a silver lode,” suggested Nestor.
“There’s plenty of silver in Mexico.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a silver mine, either,” went on the
professor. “All he found was a big hole in the
side of the mountain. He went inside and walked
for nearly a mile, his only light being a candle.
Then he came to a wall of rock. He was about
to turn back, when he noticed an opening in the
wall. It was high up, but he built a platform of
stones up and peered through the opening.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did he see?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“The remains of an ancient, buried city,” replied
Professor Snodgrass. “The mountain was
nothing more than a big mound of earth, with an
opening in the top, through which daylight entered.
The shaft through the side led to the edge of the
city. My friend gazed in on the remains of a place
thousands of years old. The buildings were mostly
in ruins, but they showed they had once been of
great size and beauty. There were wide streets
with what had been fountains in them. There was
not a vestige of a living creature. It was as if some
pestilence had fallen on the place and the people
had all left.”</p>

<p>“Did he crawl through the hole in the wall and
go into the deserted city?” asked Nestor, with keen
interest.</p>

<p>“He wanted to,” answered the naturalist, “but
he thought it would be risky, alone as he was. So
he made a rough map of as much of the place as
he could see, including his route in traveling to the
mountain. Then he retraced his steps, intending
to organize a searching party of scientists and examine
the buried city.”</p>

<p>“Did he do it?” came from Bob, who was listening
eagerly.</p>

<p>“No. Unfortunately, he was taken ill with a
fever as soon as he got back to civilization, and he
died shortly afterward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Too bad,” murmured Jerry. “It would have
been a great thing to have given to the world news
of such a place in Mexico. It’s all lost now.”</p>

<p>“Not all,” said the professor, in a queer voice.</p>

<p>“Why not? Didn’t you say your friend
died?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but before he expired he told me the story
and gave me the map.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Nestor, sitting up and
dropping his pipe in his excitement.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed the professor, extending a
piece of paper, which he had brought forth from
his possessions.</p>

<p>Eagerly, they all bent forward to examine the
map in the light of the camp-fire. The drawing
was crude enough, and showed that the buried city
lay to the east of the chain of Sierra Madre Mountains,
and about five hundred miles to the north of
the City of Mexico.</p>

<p>“There’s the place,” said the professor, pointing
with his finger to the buried city. “How I
wish I could go there! It has always been my
desire to follow the footsteps of my unfortunate
friend. Perhaps I might discover the buried city.
I could investigate it, make discoveries and write
a book about it. That would be the height of my
ambition. But I’m afraid I’ll never be able to do
it.”</p>

<p>For a few minutes there was silence about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
camp-fire, each one thinking of the mysterious city
that was not so very many miles from them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ned jumped to his feet and gave a yell.</p>

<p>“Whoop!” he cried. “I have it! It will be the
very thing!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />
<small>NEWS OF NODDY NIXON.</small></h2>


<p>“What’s the matter? Bit by a kissin’ bug?”
asked Nestor, as Ned was capering about.</p>

<p>“Nope! I’m going to find that buried city,” replied
Ned.</p>

<p>“He’s loony!” exclaimed the miner. “He’s been
sleepin’ in the moonlight. That’s a bad thing to
do, Ned.”</p>

<p>“I’m not crazy,” spoke the boy. “I have a plan.
If you don’t want to listen to it, all right,” and he
started for the cabin.</p>

<p>“What is it, tell us, will you?” came from the
professor, who was in earnest about everything.</p>

<p>“I just thought we might make a trip to Mexico
in the automobile, and hunt for that lost city,” said
Ned. “We could easily make the trip. It would
be fun, even if we didn’t find the place, and the
gold mine is now in good shape, so that we could
leave, isn’t it, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can run the mine, all right,” spoke Nestor.
“If you boys want to go traipsin’ off to
Mexico, why, go ahead, as far as I’m concerned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Better ask your folks first, though. I reckon you
an’ the professor could make the trip, easy enough,
but I won’t gamble on your finding the buried city,
for I’ve heard such stories before, an’ they don’t
very often come true.”</p>

<p>“Dearly as I would like to make the trip in the
automobile, and sure as I feel that we could do it,
I think we had better sleep on the plan,” said Professor
Snodgrass. “If you are of the same mind in
the morning we will consider it further.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go, first rate,” came from Jerry.</p>

<p>“Same here,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>That night each of the boys dreamed of walking
about in some ancient towns, where the buildings
were of gold and silver, set with diamonds, and
where the tramp of soldiers’ feet resounded on the
paved courtyards of the palaces of the Montezumas.</p>

<p>“Waal,” began Nestor, who was up early, making
the coffee, when the boys turned out of their
bunks, “air ye goin’ to start for Mexico to-day, or
wait till to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we could make the trip?”
asked Jerry, seriously.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can make it, all right, but you’ll have
troubles. In the first place, Mexico ain’t the
United States, an’ there’s a queer lot of people,
mostly bad, down there. You’ll have to be on the
watch all the while, but if you’re careful I guess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
you’ll git along. But come on, now, help git breakfust.”</p>

<p>Through the meal, though the boys talked little,
it was evident they were thinking of nothing but
the trip to Mexico.</p>

<p>“I’m going to write home now and find if I can
go,” said Ned.</p>

<p>Jerry and Bob said they would do the same, and
soon three letters were ready to be sent.</p>

<p>After their usual round of duties at the mine,
which consisted in making out reports, dealing out
supplies, and checking up the loads of ore, the boys
went to town in the auto to mail their letters. It
was a pleasant day for the trip, and they made
good time.</p>

<p>“It will be just fine if we can go,” said Bob.
“Think of it, we may find the buried city and discover
the stores of gold hidden by the inhabitants.”</p>

<p>“I guess all the gold the Mexicans ever had was
gobbled up by the Spaniards,” put in Jerry.</p>

<p>“But we may find a store of curios, relics and
other things worth more than gold,” added Ned.
“If we take the professor with us that’s what he
would care about more than money. I do hope we
can go.”</p>

<p>“It’s going to be harder to find than the lost
gold mine was,” said Jerry. “That map the professor
has isn’t much to go by.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it will be fun hunting for the place,” went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
on Bob. “We may find the city before we know
it.”</p>

<p>In due time the boys reached town and mailed
their letters. There was some excitement in the
village over a robbery that had occurred, and the
sheriff was organizing a posse to go in search of a
band of horse thieves.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to go ’long?” asked the official
of the boys, whom he knew from having aided
them in the battle at the mine against Noddy Nixon
and his friends some time before. “Come along
in the choo-choo wagon. I’ll swear you in as special
deputies.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks, just the same,” Jerry said. “We
are pretty busy up at the diggings and can’t spare
the time.”</p>

<p>“Like to have you,” went on the sheriff, genially.
“You could make good time in the gasolene gig
after those hoss thieves.”</p>

<p>But the boys declined. They had been through
enough excitement in securing the gold mine to last
them for a while.</p>

<p>“We must stop at the store and get some bacon,”
said Ned. “Nestor told me as we were coming
away. There’s none at the camp.”</p>

<p>Bidding the sheriff good-by, and waiting until
he had ridden off at the head of his forces, the
boys turned their auto toward the general store,
located on the main street of Rockyford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Howdy, lads!” exclaimed the proprietor, as he
came to the door to greet them. “What is it to-day,
gasolene or cylinder oil?”</p>

<p>“Bacon,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“Got some prime,” the merchant said. “Best
that ever come off a pig. How much do you
want?”</p>

<p>“Twenty pounds will do this time,” answered
Jerry. “We may not be here long, and we don’t
want to stock up too heavily.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t thinkin’ of goin’ back East, are ye?”
exclaimed the storekeeper.</p>

<p>“More likely to go South,” put in Ned. “We
were thinking of Mexico.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” cried the vendor of bacon
and other sundries. “Got another gold mine in
sight down there?”</p>

<p>“No; but&mdash;&mdash;” and then Ned subsided, at a
warning punch in the side from Jerry, who was not
anxious to have the half-formed plans made public.</p>

<p>“You was sayin’&mdash;&mdash;” began the storekeeper,
as if desirous of hearing more.</p>

<p>“Oh, we may take a little vacation trip down
into Mexico,” said Jerry, in a careless tone. “We’ve
been working pretty hard and we need a rest. But
nothing has been decided yet.”</p>

<p>“Mexico must be quite a nice place,” went on
the merchant.</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” asked Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“I heard of another automobilin’ party that went
there not long ago.”</p>

<p>“Who was it?” spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>“Some chap named Dixon or Pixon or Sixon, I
forget exactly what it was.”</p>

<p>“Was it Nixon?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s it! Noddy Nixon, I remember now.
He had a chap with him named Perry or Ferry or
Kerry or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Bill Berry, maybe,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“That was it! Berry. Queer what a poor memory
I have for names. And there was another with
him. Let’s see, I have it; no, that wasn’t it. Oh,
yes, Hensett!”</p>

<p>“You mean Dalsett,” put in Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s it! Dalsett! And there was another
named Jack Pender. There, I bet I’ve got that
right.”</p>

<p>“You have,” said Jerry. “You say they went to
Mexico?”</p>

<p>“You see, it was this way,” the storekeeper went
on. “It was about three weeks ago. They come
up in a big automobile, like yours, an’ bought a lot
of stuff. I kind of hinted to find out where they was
headed for, an’ all the satisfaction I got was that
that there Nixon feller says as how he guessed
Mexico would be the best place for them, as the
United States Government hadn’t no control down
there. Then one of the others says Mexico would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
suit him. So I guess they went. Now, is there
anything else I can let you have?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, this will be all,” replied Jerry, paying
for the bacon.</p>

<p>The boys waited until they were some distance
on the road before they spoke about the news the
storekeeper had told them.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if Noddy and his
gang had gone to Mexico,” said Ned. “That’s the
safest place for them, after what they did.”</p>

<p>“I wish they weren’t there, if we are to take a
trip in that country,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s a big place, I guess they won’t bother us,”
came from Jerry.</p>

<p>But he was soon to find that Mexico was not
big enough to keep Noddy and his crowd from
making much trouble and no little danger for him
and his friends.</p>

<p>They arrived at camp early in the afternoon and
told Nestor the news they had heard. He did not
attach much importance to it, as he was busy over
an order for new mining machinery.</p>

<p>There was plenty for the boys to do about camp,
and soon they were so occupied that they almost
forgot there was such a place as Mexico.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />
<small>OVER THE RIO GRANDE.</small></h2>


<p>A week later, during which there had been busy
days at the mining camp, the boys received answers
to their letters. They came in the shape of telegrams,
for the lads had asked their parents to
wire instead of waiting to write. Each one received
permission to make the trip into the land of
the Montezumas.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled Bob, making an ineffectual
attempt to turn a somersault, and coming down
all in a heap.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Nestor, coming out
of the cabin. “Wasp sting ye?”</p>

<p>“We can go to Mexico!” cried Ned, waving the
telegram.</p>

<p>“Same thing,” replied the miner. “Ye’ll git bit
by sand fleas, tarantulas, scorpions, centipedes,
horse-flies an’ rattlesnakes, down there. Better
stay here.”</p>

<p>“Is it as bad as that?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“If it is I’ll get the finest collection of bugs the
college ever saw,” put in Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Well, it may not be quite as bad, but it’s bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
enough,” qualified Nestor. “But don’t let me discourage
you. Go ahead, this is a free country.”</p>

<p>So it was arranged. The boys decided they
would start in three days, taking the professor
with them.</p>

<p>“And we’ll find that buried city if it’s there,”
put in Ned.</p>

<p>The next few days were busy ones. At Nestor’s
suggestion each one of the boys had a stout
money-belt made, in which they could carry their
cash strapped about their waists. They were going
into a wild country, the miner told them, where
the rights of people were sometimes disregarded.</p>

<p>Then the auto was given a thorough overhauling,
new tires were put on the rear wheels, and
a good supply of ammunition was packed up. In
addition, many supplies were loaded into the machine,
and Professor Snodgrass got an enlarged box
made for his specimens, as well as two new butterfly
nets.</p>

<p>The boys invested in stout shoes and leggins,
for they felt they might have to make some explorations
in a wild country. A good camp cooking
outfit was taken along, and many articles that
Nestor said would be of service during the trip.</p>

<p>“Your best way to go,” said the miner, “will be
to scoot along back into New Mexico for a ways,
then take over into Texas, and strike the Rio
Grande below where the Conchas River flows into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
it. This will save you a lot of mountain climbing
an’ give you a better place to cross the Rio Grande.
At a place about ten miles below the Conchas
there is a fine flat-boat ferriage. You can take the
machine over on that.”</p>

<p>The boys promised to follow this route. Final
preparations were made, letters were written home,
the auto was gone over for the tenth time by Jerry,
and having received five hundred dollars each from
Nestor, as their share in the mine receipts up to
the time they left, they started off with a tooting of
the auto horn.</p>

<p>“That’s more money than I ever had at one time
before,” said Bob, patting his money-belt as he
settled himself comfortably down in the rear seat
of the car, beside Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Money is no good,” said the naturalist.</p>

<p>“No good?”</p>

<p>“No; I’d rather catch a pink and blue striped
sand flea, which is the rarest kind that exists, than
have all the money in the world. If I can get one
of them or even a purple muskrat, and find the
buried city, that will be all I want on this earth.”</p>

<p>“I certainly hope we find the buried city,” spoke
up Ned, who was listening to the conversation,
“but I wouldn’t care much for a purple muskrat.”</p>

<p>“Well, every one to his taste,” said the professor.
“We may find both.”</p>

<p>The journey, which was to prove a long one, full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of surprises and dangers, was now fairly begun.
The auto hummed along the road, making fast
time.</p>

<p>That night the adventurers spent in a little town
in New Mexico. Their arrival created no little
excitement, as it was the first time an auto had been
in that section. Such a crowd of miners and cowboys
surrounded the machine that Jerry, who was
steering, had to shut off the power in a hurry to
avoid running one man down.</p>

<p>“I thought maybe ye could jump th’ critter over
me jest like they do circus hosses,” explained the
one who had nearly been hit by the car. Jerry
laughingly disclaimed any such powers of the machine.</p>

<p>Two days later found them in Texas, and, recalling
Nestor’s directions about crossing the Rio
Grande, they kept on down the banks of that
mighty river until they passed the junction where
the Conchas flows in.</p>

<p>So far the trip had been without accident. The
machine ran well and there was no trouble with
the mechanism or the tires. Just at dusk, one night,
they came to a small settlement on the Rio Grande.
They rode through the town until they came to a
sort of house-boat on the edge of the stream. A
sign over the entrance bore the words:</p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Ferry Here.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is the place we’re looking for, I guess,”
said Jerry. He drove the machine up to the entrance
and brought it to a stop. A dark-featured
man, with a big scar down one side of his face,
slouched to the door.</p>

<p>“Well?” he growled.</p>

<p>“We’d like to be ferried over to the other side,”
spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>“Come to-morrow,” snarled the man. “We
don’t work after five o’clock.”</p>

<p>“But we’d like very much to get over to-night,”
went on Jerry. “And if it’s any extra trouble we’d
be willing to pay for it.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way with you rich chaps that rides
around in them horseless wagons,” went on the
ferrymaster. “Ye think a man has got to be at
yer beck an’ call all the while. I’ll take ye over,
but it’ll cost ye ten dollars.”</p>

<p>“We’ll pay it,” said Jerry, for he observed a
crowd of rough men gathering, whose looks he did
not like, and he thought he and his friends would
be better off on the other side of the stream, on
Mexican territory.</p>

<p>“Must be in a bunch of hurry,” growled the
man. “Ain’t tryin’ to git away from th’ law, be
ye?”</p>

<p>“Not that we know of,” laughed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Looks mighty suspicious,” snarled the man.
“But, come on. Run yer shebang down on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
boat, an’ go careful or you’ll go through the bottom.
The craft ain’t built to carry locomotives.”</p>

<p>Jerry steered the car down a slight incline onto a
big flat boat, where it was blocked by chunks of
wood so that it could not roll forward or backward.</p>

<p>By this time the ferrymaster and his crew had
come down to the craft. They were all rather unpleasant-looking
men, with bold, hard faces, and
it was evident that each one of the five, who made
up the force that rowed the boat across the stream,
was heavily armed. They wore bowie-knives and
carried two revolvers apiece.</p>

<p>But the sight of armed men was no new one to
the boys since their experience in the mining camp,
and they had come to know that the chap who
made the biggest display of an arsenal was usually
the one who was the biggest coward, seldom having
use for a gun or a knife.</p>

<p>“All ready?” growled the ferryman.</p>

<p>“All ready,” called Jerry. He and the other
boys, with the professor, had alighted from the
auto and stood beside it on the flat boat.</p>

<p>Pulling on the long sweeps, the men sent the
boat out into the stream, which, at this point, was
about a mile wide. Once beyond the shore the
force of the current made itself felt, and it was
no easy matter to keep the boat headed right.</p>

<p>Every now and then the ferryman would cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
anxious looks at the sky, and several times he urged
the men to row faster.</p>

<p>“Do you think it is going to storm, my dear
friend?” asked the professor, in a kindly and
gentle voice.</p>

<p>“Think it, ye little bald-headed runt! I know
it is!” exploded the man. “And if it ketches us out
here there’s goin’ to be trouble.”</p>

<p>The sky was blacking up with heavy clouds, and
the wind began to blow with considerable force.
The boat seemed to make little headway, though
the men strained at the long oars.</p>

<p>“Row, ye lazy dogs!” exclaimed the pilot. “Do
ye want to upset with this steam engine aboard?
Row, if ye want to git ashore!”</p>

<p>The men fairly bent the stout sweeps. The wind
increased in violence, and quite high waves rocked
the ferryboat. The sky was getting blacker.
Jagged lightning came from the clouds, and the
rumble of thunder could be heard.</p>

<p>“Row, I tell ye! Row!” yelled the pilot, but
the men could do no more than they were doing.
The big boat tossed and rocked, and the automobile
started to slide forward.</p>

<p>“Fasten it with a rope!” cried Jerry, and aided
by his companions they lashed the car fast.</p>

<p>“Look out! We’re in for it now!” shouted the
ferryman. “Here comes the storm!”</p>

<p>With a wild burst of sky artillery, the clouds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
opened amid a dazzling electrical display, and the
rain came down in torrents. At the same time the
wind increased to hurricane force, driving the boat
before it like a cork on the waves.</p>

<p>Three of the men lost their oars, and the craft,
with no steerage way, was tossed from side to
side. Then, as there came a stronger blast of the
gale, the boat was driven straight ahead.</p>

<p>“We’re going to hit something!” yelled Jerry,
peering through the mist of rain. “Hold fast,
everybody!”</p>

<p><a href="#image02">The next instant there was a resounding crash</a>,
and the sound of breaking and splintering wood.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />
<small>A THIEF IN THE NIGHT.</small></h2>


<p>The shock was so hard that every one on the
ferryboat was knocked down, and the auto, breaking
from the restraining ropes, ran forward and
brought up against the shelving prow of the scow.</p>

<p>“Here, where you fellers goin’?” demanded a
voice from amid the scene of wreckage and confusion.
“What do ye mean by tryin’ t’ smash me
all to splinters?”</p>

<p>At the same time this remonstrance was accompanied
by several revolver shots. Then came a
volley of language in choice Spanish, and the noise
of several men chopping away at planks and
boards.</p>

<p>The wind continued to blow and the rain to fall,
while the lightning and thunder were worse than
before. But the ferryboat no longer tossed and
pitched on the storm-lashed river. It remained
stationary.</p>

<p>“Now we’re in for it,” shouted the ferryman, as
soon as he had scrambled to his feet. “A nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
kettle of fish I’m in for takin’ this automobile over
on my boat!”</p>

<p>“What has happened?” asked Jerry, trying to
look through the mist of falling rain, and seeing
nothing but a black object, as large as a house,
looming up before him.</p>

<p>“Matter!” exclaimed the pilot. “We’ve gone
and smashed plumb into Don Alvarzo’s house-boat
and done no end of damage. Wait until he
makes you fellers pay for it.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t our fault,” began Jerry. “You were
in charge of the ferryboat. We are only passengers.
Besides, we couldn’t stop the storm from
coming up.”</p>

<p>“Tell that to Don Alvarzo,” sneered the ferryman.
“Maybe he’ll believe you. But here he
comes himself, and we can see what has happened.”</p>

<p>Several Mexicans bearing lanterns now approached.
At their head was a tall, swarthy man,
wearing a big cloak picturesquely draped over his
shoulders, velvet trousers laced with silver, and a
big sombrero.</p>

<p>By the lantern light it could be seen that the
ferryboat had jammed head-on against the side of
a large house-boat moored on the Mexican side of
the Rio Grande. So hard had the scow rammed
the other craft that the two were held together by
a mass of splintered wood, the front of the ferryboat
breaking a hole in the side of the house-boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and sticking there. The automobile had nearly
gone overboard.</p>

<p>Don Alvarzo began to speak quickly in Spanish,
pointing to the damage done.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Jerry, taking off his
cap and bowing in spite of the rain that was still
coming down in torrents. “I beg your pardon,
señor, but if you would be so kind as to speak in
English we could understand it better.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my dear young sir,” replied Don Alvarzo,
bowing in his turn, determined not to be outdone
by an <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americano</i>. “I speak English also.
But what is this? <em lang="es" xml:lang="es">Diablo!</em> I am taking my meal
on my house-boat. I smoke my cigarette, and am
thankful that I am not out in the storm. Presto!
There comes a crash like unto that the end of the
world is nigh! I rise! I run! I fire my revolver,
thinking it may be robbers! My <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americano</i> manager
he calls out! Now, if you please, what is it
all about?”</p>

<p>“The storm got the best of the ferryboat,” said
Jerry. “My friends and myself, including Professor
Uriah Snodgrass, of whom you may have
heard, for he is a great scientist&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I salute the professor,” interrupted Don Alvarzo,
bowing to the naturalist.</p>

<p>“Well, we are going to make a trip through
Mexico,” went on Jerry. “We engaged this man,”
pointing to the ferrymaster, “to take us over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
river in his boat. Unfortunately we crashed into
yours. It was not our fault.”</p>

<p>Angry cries from the Mexicans who stood in a
half circle about Don Alvarzo on the deck of the
house-boat showed that they understood this talk,
but did not approve of it.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americanos</i> pigs! Make pay!” called out one
man.</p>

<p>“We’re not pigs, and if this accident is our
fault we will pay at once,” said Jerry, hotly.</p>

<p>“There, there, señor,” said the Don, motioning
to his man to be quiet. “We will consider this.
It appears that you are merely passengers on the
ferryboat. The craft was in charge of Señor
Jenkins, there, whom I very well know. He will
pay me for the damage, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“You never made a bigger mistake in your life!”
exclaimed Jenkins. “If there’s any payin’ to be
done, these here automobile fellers will have
to do it. I’m out of pocket now with
chargin’ ’em only ten dollars, for three of my
oars are lost.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, we will let the law take its
course,” said the Don. “Here!” he called to his
men, “take the ferry captain into custody. We’ll
see who is to pay.”</p>

<p>“Rather than have trouble and delay we would
be willing to settle for the damages,” spoke up
Jerry. “How much is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will have to refer you to Señor Jones, my
manager,” said the Mexican.</p>

<p>“What’s all the row about?” interrupted a voice,
and a tall, lanky man came forward into the circle
of lantern light. “People can’t expect to smash
boats an’ not pay for ’em.”</p>

<p>“We are perfectly willing to pay,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, if there ain’t my old friend Professor
Snodgrass!” cried Jones, jumping down on the flat-boat
and shaking hands with the naturalist. “Well,
well, this is a sight for sore eyes. I ain’t seen ye
since I was janitor in your laboratory in Wellville
College. How are ye?”</p>

<p>The professor, surprised to meet an acquaintance
under such strange circumstances, managed to say
that he was in good health.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” went on Jones, “I’ll soon settle
this. Look here, Don Alvarzo,” he went on, “these
is friends of mine. If there’s any damage&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I assure you, not a penny, not a penny!”
exclaimed the Mexican. “I regret that my boat
was in their way. I beg a thousand pardons. Say
not a word more, my dear professor and young
friends, but come aboard and partake of such poor
hospitality as Don Miguel Fernandez Alvarzo can
offer. I am your most humble servant.”</p>

<p>The boys and the professor were glad enough
of the turn events had taken. At a few quick
orders from Jones and the Don, the Mexicans and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the ferry captain’s crew backed the scow away
from the house-boat. A landing on shore was
made, the automobile run off, and the ferryman
having been paid his money, with something extra
for the lost oars, pulled off into the rain and darkness,
growling the while.</p>

<p>“Now you must come in out of the rain,” said
Don Alvarzo, as soon as the auto had been covered
with a tarpaulin, carried in case of bad
weather. “We can dry and feed you, at all
events.”</p>

<p>It was a pleasant change from the storm outside
to the warm and well-lighted house-boat. The
thunder and lightning had ceased, but the rain
kept up and the wind howled unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“I regret that your advent into this wonderful
land of Mexico should be fraught with such inauspicious
a beginning as this outburst of the elements,”
spoke Don Alvarzo, with a bow, as he
ushered his guests into the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we’re used to bad weather,” said Bob,
cheerfully.</p>

<p>In a little while the travelers had divested themselves
of their wet garments and donned dry ones
from their valises that had been brought in from
the auto. Soon they sat down to a bountiful meal
in which red peppers, garlic and frijoles, with eggs
and chicken, formed a prominent part. Jones, the
Don’s manager, ate with them, and told how, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
his younger days, he had worked at a college where
Professor Snodgrass had been an instructor.</p>

<p>Supper over, they all gathered about a comfortable
fire and, in answer to questions from Don Alvarzo,
the boys told something of their plans, not,
however, revealing their real object.</p>

<p>“I presume you are searching for silver mines,”
said the Don, with a laugh and a sly wink. “Believe
me, all the silver and gold, too, is taken out
of my unfortunate country. You had much better
go to raising cattle. Now, I have several nice
ranches I could sell you. What do you say? Shall
we talk business?”</p>

<p>But Jerry, assuming the rôle of spokesman, decided
they had no inclination to embark in business
just yet. They might consider it later, he said.</p>

<p>The Don looked disappointed, but did not press
the point. The evening was passed pleasantly
enough, and about nine o’clock, as the travelers
showed signs of fatigue, Jones suggested that beds
might be agreeable.</p>

<p>“I am sorry I cannot give you sleeping apartments
together,” remarked the Don. “I can put
two of you boys in one room, give the professor
another small room, and the third boy still another.
It is the best arrangement I can make.”</p>

<p>“That will suit us,” replied Jerry. “Ned and I
will bunk together.”</p>

<p>“Very well; if you will follow my man he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
escort you to your rooms,” went on the Mexican.
“Perhaps the professor will sit up and smoke.”</p>

<p>The naturalist said he never smoked, and, besides,
he was so tired that bed was the best place
for him. So he followed the boys, and soon the
travelers were lighted to their several apartments.
Ned and Jerry found themselves together, the professor
had a room at one end of a long gangway
and Bob an apartment at the other end. Good-nights
were called, and the adventurers prepared to
get whatever rest they might.</p>

<p>As Ned and Jerry were getting undressed they
heard a low knock on their door.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Hush! Not so loud!” came in cautious tones.
“This is Jones. Keep your guns handy, that’s all.
I can’t tell you any more,” and then the boys heard
him moving away.</p>

<p>“Well, I must say that’s calculated to induce
sleep,” remarked Ned. “Keep your guns
handy! I wonder if we’ve fallen into a robber’s
den?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the looks of things,” commented
Jerry. “The Don may be all right, and probably
is, but he has a lot of ugly-looking Mexicans on his
boat. I guess we’ll watch out. I hope Jones will
warn the others.”</p>

<p>There came a second knock on the door.</p>

<p>“What is it?” called Jerry, in a whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve warned your friends,” replied Jones.
“Now watch out. I can’t say any more.”</p>

<p>His footsteps died away down the gangway.
Jerry and Ned looked at each other.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll sit up the rest of the night,” said
Ned.</p>

<p>They started their vigil. But they were very
tired and soon, before either of them knew it, they
were nodding. Several times they roused themselves,
but nature at length gained the mastery and
soon they were both stretched out asleep on the
bed.</p>

<p>About three o’clock in the morning there came a
cautious trying of the door of the room where Ned
and Jerry were sleeping. Soft footsteps sounded
outside. If ever the boys needed to be awake it
was now, for there was a thief in the night stealing
in upon them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />
<small>INTO THE WILDERNESS.</small></h2>


<p>Jerry had a curious dream. He thought he was
back in Cresville and was playing a game of ball.
He had reached second base safely and was standing
there when the player on the other side grabbed
him by his belt and began to pull him away.</p>

<p>“Here! Stop that! It’s not in the game!” exclaimed
Jerry, struggling to get away. So real was
the effort that he awakened. He looked up, and
there, standing over him in the darkness, was a dim
form.</p>

<p>“Silence!” hissed a voice. “One move and I’ll
kill you. Remain quiet and you shall not be
harmed!”</p>

<p>Jerry had sense enough to obey. He was wide
awake now and knew that he was at the mercy of
a Mexican robber. The man was struggling to
undo the lad’s money-belt about his waist, and it
was this that had caused the boy’s vivid dream.</p>

<p>Jerry had been kicking his feet about rather
freely, but now he stretched out and submitted to
the mauling to which the robber was subjecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
him. If only Ned would awake, Jerry thought, for
Ned, he knew, had his revolver ready in his hand.</p>

<p>With a yank the thief took off Jerry’s belt containing
the money.</p>

<p>“Lie still or you die!” the fellow exclaimed.</p>

<p>Then he moved over to where Ned reclined on
the bed. Jerry could see more plainly now, for the
storm had ceased, the moon had risen and a stray
beam came in the side window of the house-boat.
The robber stretched out his hand to Ned’s waist.
He was about to reach under the coat and unbuckle
the money-belt, when Ned suddenly sat upright.
In his hand he held his revolver, which he
pointed full in the face of the marauder.</p>

<p>“Drop that knife!” exclaimed Ned, for the
Mexican held a sharp blade in his hand.</p>

<p>“Bah!” the fellow exclaimed, but the steel fell
with a clang to the floor.</p>

<p>“Now lay the money-belt on the bed, if you don’t
want me to shoot!” said the boy, pushing the cold
steel of the weapon against the Mexican’s face.</p>

<p>“Pardon, señor, it was all a joke! Don’t shoot!”
the fellow uttered, in a trembling voice, at the same
time tossing the belt over to Jerry, who had drawn
his own revolver from under the pillow where he
had placed it.</p>

<p>“Light the candle, Jerry,” went on Ned, “while
I keep him covered with the gun. We’ll see what
sort of a chap he is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry rose to find matches. But the robber did
not wait for this. With a bound he leaped to the
window. One jump took him through, and a second
later a splash in the river outside told how he
had escaped.</p>

<p>Ned ran to the casement and fired two shots, not
with any intention of hitting the man, but to arouse
his friends. In an instant there was confused shouting,
lights gleamed in several rooms, and Don
Alvarzo came hurrying in.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What is it all about? Is
any one killed?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Nothing much has happened,” said Ned, as
coolly as possible under the circumstances. “A
burglar got in the room and got out again.”</p>

<p>“A burglar? A thief? Impossible! In my
house-boat? Where did he go? Did he get anything?”</p>

<p>“He got Jerry’s money-belt,” said Ned,
“but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A money-belt! Santa Maria! Was there much
in it?” and Ned thought he saw a gleam come into
the Don’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, he didn’t get it to keep!” went on Jerry.
“We both fell asleep, and the fellow robbed Jerry
first. I was awakened by feeling Jerry accidentally
kick me. I saw the robber take his belt, but when
he came for mine I was ready for him. I made
him give Jerry’s back&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Made him give it back!” exclaimed Don Alvarzo,
and Ned fancied he detected disappointment
in his host’s face. “You are a brave lad.
Where did the fiend go?”</p>

<p>“Out of the window,” answered Ned. “I fired
at him to give him a scare.”</p>

<p>“I am disgraced that such a thing should happen
in my house!” exclaimed the Don, and this
time it was Jerry who noticed Jones, the American
manager, winking one eye as he stood behind his
employer. “I am disgraced,” went on the Mexican.
“But never mind, I shall inform the authorities
and they will hang every robber they catch to
please me.”</p>

<p>“I’m robbed! I’m robbed!” exclaimed Professor
Snodgrass, bursting into the room. He was attired
in blue pajamas, and his bald head was shining
in the candle light.</p>

<p>“What did they get from you?” asked the Don,
his face once more showing interest.</p>

<p>“The rascals took three fine specimens of sand
fleas from me!” exclaimed the naturalist. “The
loss is irreparable!”</p>

<p>“<em lang="es" xml:lang="es">Diablo!</em>” exclaimed the Don, under his breath.
“Three sand fleas! Ah, these crazy <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americanos</i>!”</p>

<p>“I fancy you can get more, Professor,” said
Jones, with a laugh. “Well, there seems to be no
great damage done. I reckon we can all go back
to bed now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The servants, who had been aroused by the commotion,
went back to their rooms. In a little
while the Don, with many and profuse apologies,
withdrew, and the professor and Bob
returned to their apartments. Jones was the
last to go.</p>

<p>“I told you to be on the watch,” he whispered,
as he prepared to leave. “I overheard some of the
rascals making up a game to relieve you of some
of your cash. I wouldn’t say the Don was in on
it, but the sooner you get out of this place the
better. You can go to sleep now. There is no more
danger. Lucky one of you happened to wake up
in time or you’d have been cleaned out. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said Ned and Jerry, as they
locked their door, which had been opened by false
keys. They went to bed and slept soundly until
daybreak, in spite of the excitement. Nor were
they disturbed again.</p>

<p>Don Alvarzo talked of nothing but the attempted
robbery the next morning at breakfast.
He declared he had sent one of his men post-haste
to inform the authorities, who, he said, would dispatch
a troop of soldiers to search for the miscreant.</p>

<p>“I am covered with confusion that my guests
should be so insulted,” he said.</p>

<p>But, somehow, his voice did not ring true. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
boys and the professor, however, thanked him for
his consideration and hospitality.</p>

<p>“I think we must be traveling now,” announced
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Will you not pass another night under my
roof?” asked the Don. “I promise you that you
will not be awakened by robbers again.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said Jerry. Afterward, he
said the Don might carry out his promise too literally,
and take means to prevent them from waking
if thieves did enter their rooms. So, amid protestations
that he was disappointed at the shortness
of their stay, and begging them to come and see
him again, the Don said farewell.</p>

<p>“I think, perhaps, we ought to pay for the damage
to your boat,” said Jerry, not wishing to be
under any obligations to the Mexican.</p>

<p>“Do not insult me, I beg of you!” exclaimed the
Don, and he really seemed so hurt that Jerry did
not press it. Then, with a toot of the horn, the
auto started off on the trip through Mexico.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day, and the boys were enchanted
with the scenery. Behind them lay the
broad Rio Grande, while off to the right were the
foothills that increased in height and size until they
became the mighty mountains. The foliage was
deep green from the recent shower, and the sun
shone, making the whole country appear a most
delightful place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“It looked as if our entrance into Mexico was
not going to be very pleasant,” said Jerry, “especially
during the storm and the smash-up with the
house-boat. But to-day it couldn’t be better.”</p>

<p>“That was a close call you and Ned had,” put
in Bob. “I wonder why they didn’t tackle me?”</p>

<p>“Because you are so good-natured-looking the
robbers knew you never had any money,” replied
Jerry, with a laugh. “I wonder what Chunky
would have done if a Mexican brigand had demanded
his money-belt?”</p>

<p>“He could have had it without me making a
fuss,” replied the stout youth. “Money is a good
thing, but I think more of myself than half a
dozen money-belts.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my poor fleas!” exclaimed the professor.
“I wonder if the robber killed them.”</p>

<p>“I guess they hopped away,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“No, they would never leave me,” went on the
naturalist.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad I haven’t such an intimate acquaintance
with them as that,” commented Jerry,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, they were tame. They never bit me once,”
the professor said, with pride in his voice.</p>

<p>With Ned at the steering-wheel, the auto made
good time. The road was a fair one, skirting the
edge of a vast plain for several miles. About noon
the path led into a dense forest, where there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
barely room for the machine to pass the thick trees
and vines that bordered the way on either side.</p>

<p>“I hope we don’t get caught in this wilderness,”
said Ned, making a skilful turn to avoid a fallen
tree.</p>

<p>“Supposing we stop now and get dinner,”
suggested Jerry. “It’s past noon, and I’m
hungry.”</p>

<p>The plan was voted a good one. The portable
stove that burned gasolene was set going, coffee
was made and some canned chicken was warmed in
a frying pan. With some seasoning and frijoles
Don Alvarzo had given them the boys made an
excellent meal.</p>

<p>After a rest beneath the trees the boys started
off in their auto again. The road widened when
they had gone a few miles, and improved so that
traveling was easier. About dusk they came to a
small village, in the centre of which was a comfortable-looking
inn.</p>

<p>“How will that do to stop at overnight?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“First rate,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>The auto was steered into the yard, and the
proprietor of the place came out, bowing and
smiling.</p>

<p>“Your friends have just preceded you, señors,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Our friends?” asked Jerry, in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Si, señor.</i> Don Nixon and Don Pender. They
were here not above an hour ago. I think they
must be your friends, because they were in the same
sort of an engine as yourselves.”</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon here!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />
<small>A FIERCE FIGHT.</small></h2>


<p>The boys glanced at each other in blank astonishment.
As for Professor Snodgrass, he was too
occupied with chasing a little yellow tree-toad to
pay much attention to anything but the pursuit of
specimens.</p>

<p>“We seem bound to cross the trail of Noddy
sooner or later,” remarked Ned. “Well, if he’s
ahead of us he can’t be behind, that’s one consolation.”</p>

<p>“Will the honorable señors be pleased to enter
my poor inn?” spoke the Mexican, bowing low.</p>

<p>“I suppose we may as well stop here,” said Jerry,
in a low tone to his companions. “It looks like a
decent place, and it will give Noddy a chance to get
a good way ahead, which is what we want. But I
don’t see what he means by going on when it will
soon be night.”</p>

<p>The auto was run under a shed, its appearance
causing some fright among the servants and a few
travelers, who began to mutter their prayers in
Spanish. The boys, escorted by the Mexican, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
entered the hostelry. It was a small but decent-looking
place, as Jerry had said. The boys were
shown to rooms where, washing off some of the
grime of their journey, they felt better.</p>

<p>“Supper is ready,” announced the innkeeper,
who spoke fairly good English.</p>

<p>“Where is the professor?” asked Ned, as the
boys descended to the dining-room.</p>

<p>“The last I saw of him he was climbing up the
tree after that toad,” answered Bob. “But here
he comes now.”</p>

<p>The naturalist came hurrying into the room,
clasping something in his hand.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it! I’ve got it!” he shouted. “A perfect
beauty!”</p>

<p>The professor opened his fingers slightly to peer
at his prize, when the toad, taking advantage of the
opportunity, hopped on the floor and was rapidly
escaping.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, he’s got away!” the professor exclaimed.
“Help me catch him, everybody! He’s
worth a thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>The naturalist got down on his hands and knees
and began crawling after the hopping tree-toad,
while the boys could not restrain their laughter.
A crowd of servants gathered in the doorway to
watch the antics of the strange <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americano</i>.</p>

<p>“There! I have you again, my beauty!” cried
the professor, pouncing on his specimen in a corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of the room. “You shall not escape again!” and
with that he popped the toad into a small specimen
box which he always wore strapped on his back.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” began the innkeeper, in a low tone,
sidling up to Jerry, “is your elderly friend, the
bald-headed señor, is he&mdash;ah&mdash;um&mdash;is he a little,
what you <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americanos</i> call&mdash;er&mdash;wheels?” and he
moved his finger with a circular motion in front
of his forehead.</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” replied the boy. “He is
only collecting specimens for his college.”</p>

<p>The Mexican shrugged his shoulders and spread
out his hands in an apologetic sort of way, but it
was easy to see that he believed Professor Snodgrass
insane, an idea that was shared by all the
servants in the inn, for not one of them, during
the adventurers’ brief stay in the hotel, would approach
him without muttering a prayer.</p>

<p>“I wonder what we’ll have to eat?” asked Ned,
as with the others he prepared to sit down.</p>

<p>The innkeeper clapped his hands, which signal
served in lieu of a bell for the servants. In a little
while a meal of fish, eggs, chocolate and chicken,
with the ever-present frijoles and tortillas, was
served. It tasted good to the hungry lads, though
as Jerry remarked he would have preferred it just
as much if there hadn’t been so much red pepper
and garlic in everything.</p>

<p>“Water! Water! Quick!” cried Bob, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
taking a generous mouthful of frijoles, which contained
an extra amount of red pepper. “My mouth
is on fire!”</p>

<p>He swallowed a tumblerful of liquid before he
had eased the smart caused by the fiery condiment.
Thereafter he was careful to taste each dish with
a little nibble before he indulged too freely.</p>

<p>In spite of these drawbacks, the boys enjoyed
their experience, and were interested in the novelty
of everything they saw.</p>

<p>“I wonder how we are to sleep?” said Jerry,
after the meal was over. “I’ve heard that Mexican
beds were none of the best.”</p>

<p>“You shall sleep the sleep of the just, señors,”
broke in the Mexican hotel keeper, coming up just
as Jerry spoke. “My inn is full, every room is
occupied, but you shall sleep <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">en el sereno</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well, as long as it’s on a good bed in a room
where the mosquitoes can’t get in I shan’t mind
that,” spoke Bob. “I don’t know as I care much
for scenery, but if it goes with the bed, why, all
right.”</p>

<p>“You’ll sleep in no room to-night,” said Professor
Snodgrass, who for the moment was not
busy hunting specimens. “By ‘<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">en el sereno</i>’ our
friend means that you must sleep out of doors, under
the stars. It is often done in this country.
They put the beds out in the courtyard or garden
and throw a mosquito net over them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s good enough,” said Bob. “It won’t
be the first time we’ve slept in the open. Bring on
the ‘<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">en el sereno</i>,’” and he laughed, the innkeeper
joining in.</p>

<p>The beds for the travelers were soon made up.
They consisted of light cots of wood, with a few
blankets on them. Placed out in the courtyard,
under the trees, with the sky for a roof, the sleeping-places
were indeed in the open.</p>

<p>But the boys and Professor Snodgrass had no
fault to find. They had partaken of a good meal,
they were tired with their day’s journey, and about
nine o’clock voted to turn in.</p>

<p>“We’ll keep our revolvers handy this time,” said
Bob, “though I guess we won’t need ’em.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be too sure,” was Ned’s opinion, as he
took off his shoes and placed his weapon under his
pillow.</p>

<p>It was not long before snores told that the travelers
were sound asleep. For several hours the inn
bustled with life, for the Mexicans did not seem to
care much about rest. At length the place became
quiet, and at midnight there was not a sound to be
heard, save the noises of the forest, which was no
great distance away, and the vibrations caused by
the breathing of the slumberers.</p>

<p>It was about two o’clock in the morning when
Bob was suddenly awakened by feeling a hand
passed lightly over his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here!” he cried. “Get out of that!”</p>

<p>“Silence!” hissed a voice in his ear. But Bob
was too frightened to keep quiet. He gave a wild
yell and tried to struggle to his feet. Some one
thrust him back on the cot, and rough hands tried
to rip off his money-belt. The boy fought fiercely,
and struck out with both fists.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Jerry and Ned!” he yelled. “We’re
being robbed. Shoot ’em!”</p>

<p>The courtyard became a scene of wild commotion.
It was dark, for the moon was covered with
clouds, but as Jerry and Ned sat up, alarmed by
Bob’s voice, they could detect dim forms moving
about among the trees.</p>

<p>“The Mexicans are robbing us!” shouted Ned.
He drew his revolver and fired in the air for fear
of hitting one of his comrades. By the light of the
weapon’s flash he saw a man close to him. Bob
aimed the pistol in the fellow’s face and pulled the
trigger. There was a report, followed by a loud
yell. At the same time a thousand stars seemed to
dance before Ned’s eyes, and he fell back, knocked
unconscious by a hard blow.</p>

<p>Jerry had sprung to his feet, to be met by a blow
in the face from a brawny fist. He quickly recovered
himself, however, and grappled with his
assailant. He found he was but an infant in the
hands of a strong man. The boy tried to reach
for his revolver, but just as his hand touched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
butt of the weapon he received a stinging blow on
the head and he toppled over backward, his senses
leaving him.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Bob was still struggling with
the robber who had attacked him. Fleshy as he
was, Bob had considerable strength, and he
wrestled with the fellow. They both fell to the
ground and rolled over. In their struggles they
got underneath one of the beds.</p>

<p>“Let me go!” yelled Bob. At that instant he
felt the ear of his enemy come against his mouth.
The boy promptly seized the member in his teeth
and bit it hard enough to make the fellow howl for
mercy.</p>

<p>Bob suddenly found himself released, and the
robber, with a parting blow that made the boy’s
head sing, rolled away from under the bed and
took to his heels.</p>

<p>“Help! help! help!” cried Professor Snodgrass,
as Bob tried to sit upright, for it was under the
bed of the naturalist that the boy had rolled. In
straightening up he had tipped the scientist, who,
up to this point, had been sleeping soundly on the
cot.</p>

<p>“What is it? What has happened? Is it a
fire? Has an earthquake occurred? Is the river
rising? Has a tidal wave come in? Santa Maria!
But what is all the noise about?” cried the landlord,
rushing into the courtyard, bearing an ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
lantern. “What has happened, señors? Was your
rest disturbed?”</p>

<p>“Was our rest disturbed?” inquired Bob, in as
sarcastic a tone as possible under the circumstances.
“Well, I would say yes! A band of robbers attacked
us.”</p>

<p>“A band of robbers! Santa Maria! Impossible!
There are no robbers in Mexico!” and the
innkeeper began to chatter volubly in Spanish.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />
<small>THE OLD MEXICAN.</small></h2>


<p>“Well, if they weren’t robbers they were a first-class
imitation,” responded Bob. “There’s Jerry
and Ned knocked out, at any rate, and they nearly
did for me. They would have, only I bit the chap’s
ear. I guess I’ll know him again; he has my mark
on him.”</p>

<p>“Bit his ear! The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americano</i> is brave! But we
must see to the poor unfortunate señors! Robbers!
Impossible!”</p>

<p>By this time the whole inn was aroused and the
courtyard was filled with servants and guests.
Water was brought and with it Jerry and Ned
were revived.</p>

<p>“What happened?” began Jerry. “Oh, I remember
now! Did they get our money?”</p>

<p>“I guess they got yours and Ned’s,” said Bob,
in sorrowful tones, as he noted his chums’ disordered
clothing and saw that the money-belts were
gone. “They didn’t get mine, though, so we’re
not in such bad luck, after all. How do you feel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“As if a road-roller had gone over me,” replied
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Same here,” put in Ned, holding his head in his
hands. “He must have given me a pretty good
whack. Who was it robbed us?”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you were robbed, señors?” asked
the hotel keeper. “Perhaps you may have been
dreaming.”</p>

<p>“Does that look as if it was only a nightmare?”
asked Ned, showing a big lump on his head.</p>

<p>“Or this?” added Jerry, showing his clothing
cut with a knife where the robber had slashed it in
order to take out the money-belt.</p>

<p>“No, it was not a dream,” murmured the innkeeper.
“There must have been robbers here. I
wonder who they were?”</p>

<p>“They didn’t leave their cards, so it’s hard to
say,” remarked Jerry. “I don’t suppose the burglars
down here are in the habit of sending word in
advance of their visit, or of telling the police where
to find them after they commit a crime.”</p>

<p>“Never! Never!” exclaimed the Mexican host.
“But speaking of the police, I must tell them about
this some time to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Any time will do,” put in Ned. “We’re in no
hurry, you know.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of that,” said the hotel keeper, in
all seriousness. “Most <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americanos</i> are in such a
rush, and I have to go to market to-morrow. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
next day will do very well. I thank you, señors.
Now I bid you good-night, and pleasant dreams.”</p>

<p>“Well, he certainly does take things easy,” said
Jerry, when the innkeeper and his servants, with
many polite bows, had withdrawn. “He don’t
seem to care much whether we were nearly killed
or not. I guess this must be a regular occurrence
down here.”</p>

<p>“I always heard the Mexican brigands were terrible
fellows,” said Professor Snodgrass. “Now
I am sure of it. I am glad they did not get any
of my specimens, however. All my treasures are
safe.”</p>

<p>“But Ned and I have lost five hundred dollars
each,” put in Jerry.</p>

<p>“You can get more from the gold mine,” went
on the professor.</p>

<p>“Yes; but it may spoil our trip,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“I have my five hundred dollars,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“And I have nearly one thousand in bills,”
spoke the professor, in a whisper. “We will have
enough. The robbers would never suspect me of
carrying money. Listen; it is in the box with the
big lizard and the bat, and no one will ever look
there for it,” and he chuckled in silent glee.</p>

<p>“Then I guess we can go on,” said Jerry. “But
I wonder who it was robbed us?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was the Mexican brigands that
hang about every hotel,” said Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” went on Jerry. “You
know Noddy Nixon and his crowd are not far off.
It may have been they.”</p>

<p>“That’s so; I never thought of them,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Did you recognize any one?”</p>

<p>“The fellow who grappled with me had a mask
on,” said Jerry. “But I thought I recognized that
fellow Dalsett. However, I couldn’t be sure.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t get a chance to see my man,” Ned
added.</p>

<p>“The fellow who came for me had a voice like
Bill Berry’s,” put in Bob. “If I could see his
ear I could soon tell.”</p>

<p>“It will be a good while before you see his ear,”
continued Jerry. “I wonder if it was Nixon’s
crowd, or only ordinary robbers? If we are to be
attacked by Noddy and his gang all the way
through Mexico the trip will not be very
pleasant.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s only one thing certain, and that
is, the money-belts are gone,” put in Ned, gazing
ruefully at his waist around which he had strapped
his cash. “The next question is, who took
them?”</p>

<p>“Which same question is likely to remain unanswered
for some time,” interrupted Professor
Snodgrass. “Now, don’t worry, boys. We are
still able to continue on our search for the buried
city. This will teach us a lesson not to go to sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
again unless some one is on guard. The money
loss is nothing compared to the possibility that one
of us might have been killed, or some of my specimens
stolen. Now we had better all go to bed
again.”</p>

<p>“Shall we stand guard for the remainder of the
night?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I think it will not be necessary,” spoke the
professor. “The robbers are not likely to return.”</p>

<p>So, extinguishing the lantern which the innkeeper
had left, the travelers once more sought
their cots, on which they had a somewhat fitful rest
until morning.</p>

<p>At breakfast the innkeeper urged the travelers
to spend a few days at his hotel, saying he had sent
for a Government officer to come and make an investigation
of the robbery. But the boys and the
professor, thanking their host for his invitation,
called for their bill, settled it, and were soon puffing
away through the forest once more.</p>

<p>For several hours they journeyed on beneath
giant palms which lined either side of the road.
The scenery was one unending vista of green, in
which mingled brilliant-hued flowers. Wild parrots
and other birds flitted through the trees and
small animals rustled through the underbrush as
the automobile dashed by.</p>

<p>Jerry was at the steering wheel and was sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the car along at a good clip, when, as he suddenly
rounded a curve he shut off the power and applied
the brakes. Not a moment too soon was he, for
he stopped the machine only a few feet from an
aged Mexican, who was traveling along the road,
aiding his faltering steps with a large, wooden
staff.</p>

<p>The Mexican glanced at the auto which, with
throbbing breath, as the engine still continued to
vibrate, seemed to fill him with terror. Suddenly
he dropped to his knees and began to pray.</p>

<p>“Be not afraid,” Professor Snodgrass called to
him, speaking in the Spanish language. “We are
but poor travelers like yourself. We will not harm
you.”</p>

<p>“Whence do you come in your chariot of fire?”
asked the old man. “Ye are demons and no true
men!”</p>

<p>“We will not hurt you,” said the naturalist,
again. “See, we bring you gifts,” and he held out
to the Mexican a package of tobacco and a small
hand-mirror. The old man’s eyes brightened at
the sight of them. He rose to his feet and took
them, though his hands trembled.</p>

<p>In a moment he had rolled a cigarette of the
tobacco, and, puffing out great clouds of smoke,
complacently gazed at his image in the looking-glass.</p>

<p>“Truly ye are men and not demons,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
“The tobacco is very good. But whence come ye,
and whither do ye go?”</p>

<p>“We are travelers from a far land,” answered
the professor. “Whither we go we scarcely know.
We are searching for the unknown.”</p>

<p>The aged Mexican started. Then he gazed
fixedly at the professor.</p>

<p>“It may be that I can tell whither ye journey,”
he said. “For your kindness to me I am minded
to look into the future for you. Shall I?”</p>

<p>“No one can look into the future,” answered
the naturalist. “No one knows what is going to
happen.” For the professor was no believer in
anything but what nature revealed to him.</p>

<p>“Unbelievers! Unbelievers!” muttered the old
man, blowing out a great cloud of smoke. “But ye
shall see. I will read what is to happen for you.”</p>

<p>He sat down at the side of the road. In the dust
he drew a circle. This he divided into twelve
parts, and in one he placed a small quantity of
powder, which he took from his sash. The powder
he lighted with a match. There was a patch
of fire, and a cloud of yellow smoke. For an instant
the old man was hidden from view. Then
his voice was heard.</p>

<p>“Ye seek the unknown, hidden and buried city
of ancient Mexico!” he said, in startling tones.
“And ye shall find it. Yea, find it sooner than ye
think, and in a strange manner. Look behind ye!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Involuntarily the boys and the professor turned.</p>

<p>“Nothing there,” grunted Ned, as he looked
to where the old man had been seated. To his
astonishment, as well as the surprise of the others,
the aged Mexican had disappeared.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />
<small>A VIEW OF THE ENEMY.</small></h2>


<p>“Where is he?” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“He must have gone down through a hole in the
earth,” said Ned. “I didn’t have my eyes off him
three seconds. He didn’t go down the road or we
would have seen him, and he couldn’t have run
into the bushes on either side without making a
great racket. He’s a queer one.”</p>

<p>“Just like the East Indian jugglers I’ve read
about,” put in Jerry.</p>

<p>“I think probably he was something on that
order,” agreed Professor Snodgrass. “Strange
how he should have known about the buried city,
and we have spoken to no one about it since we
came to Mexico.”</p>

<p>“Let’s look and see if we can find a trace of
him,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>The boys alighted from the car. They made a
careful search around the spot where the old man
had sat. There was the circle he had drawn in
the dust, and the mark where the powder had
burned, but not another trace of the Mexican could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
they find. They looked behind trees and rocks,
but all they found was big toads and lizards that
hopped and crawled away as they approached. The
professor annexed several of the reptiles for specimens.</p>

<p>“How do you explain it all?” asked Jerry of
the naturalist, when they had taken their seats in
the automobile again. “Have those men any supernatural
powers?”</p>

<p>“I do not believe they have,” replied the professor.
“They do some things that are hard to
explain, but they are sharp enough to do their
tricks under their own conditions, and they disappear
before those who can see them have gotten
over their momentary surprise.”</p>

<p>“The disappearing was the funny part of it,”
went on Jerry. “I can understand how he made
the smoke. A pinch of gunpowder would produce
that. But how did he dissolve himself into thin
air?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t,” replied the naturalist. “I’ll tell
you how that was done. It is a favorite trick in
India. When he suddenly called to us to look behind
us he took advantage of our momentary
glance away to hide himself.”</p>

<p>“But where?”</p>

<p>“Behind that big rock,” and the naturalist
pointed to a large one near where the Mexican had
been sitting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“But we looked behind that,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, several minutes after the disappearance,”
went on the professor, with a laugh. “This was
how he did it: He wore a long, gray cloak, which,
perhaps, you didn’t notice. It was exactly the
color of the stone and was partly draped over it.
It was there all the while he was doing his trick.
I saw it, but thought nothing of it at the time.
Now, when he had finished the hocus-pocus, and
when our heads were turned, he just rolled himself
up into a ball and got under the cloak by the stone.
Of course, it looked as if he had dropped down
through the earth.”</p>

<p>“But how about him getting away so completely
that our search didn’t reveal him?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I think he waited a while and then, when he
heard us getting out of the automobile he took advantage
of the confusion to crawl, still under his
cloak, into the bushes, perhaps by a path he alone
knew. There really is no mystery to it.”</p>

<p>“How about him telling us we were searching
for the buried city?” asked Bob. “Wasn’t that
mind-reading?”</p>

<p>“I think he knew that part of it,” said the professor,
“though it seemed strange to me at first.
You must remember that the object of our trip
was pretty freely talked of back in the gold camp.
Some one may have come here from there before
we started, and, in some manner, this old Mexican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
may have heard of us. He may even have been
waiting for us. No; it looks queer when it happens,
but reasoned out, it is natural enough. However,
I am glad to know we are on the right road
and will find what we are searching for, though
the old man may be mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go forward again?” asked Jerry, resuming
his place at the steering wheel.</p>

<p>“Forward it is!” cried Ned. “Ho, for the
buried city!”</p>

<p>Once more the auto puffed along the forest road.
It was warm with the heat of the tropics, and the
boys were soon glad to take off their coats and
collars. Even with the breeze created by the movement
of the machine, it was oppressive.</p>

<p>“I say, when are we going to eat?” asked Bob.
“I know it’s long past noon.”</p>

<p>“Wrong for once, Chunky,” answered Ned,
looking at his watch. “It’s only eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s a good place to stop and eat, anyhow,”
went on the stout lad, to whom eating never
came amiss.</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll camp,” put in Jerry, bringing
the machine to a stop.</p>

<p>It was rather pleasant in the shade of the forest
in spite of the heat, and the boys enjoyed it very
much. The gasolene stove was lighted and Ned
made some chocolate, for, since their advent into
Mexico the travelers had come to like this beverage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
which almost every one down in that country
drinks. With this and some frijoles and cold
chicken brought from the inn, they made a good
meal.</p>

<p>“I’m going to hunt for some specimens,” announced
the professor. “You boys can rest here
for an hour or so.”</p>

<p>With his green collecting box and his butterfly
net the naturalist disappeared along a path that led
through the forest.</p>

<p>“I suppose he’ll come back with a blue-nosed
baboon or a flat-headed gila monster,” said Ned.
“He does find the queerest things.”</p>

<p>It was almost an hour later, when the boys were
wondering what had become of the naturalist, that
they heard faint shouts in the direction he had
taken.</p>

<p>“Hurry, boys!” the professor’s voice called.
“Hurry! Help! help! I’m caught!”</p>

<p>“He’s in trouble again!” exclaimed Ned. “We
must go to his rescue!”</p>

<p>“Have you got your revolver?” asked Jerry, as
Ned was about to rush away.</p>

<p>“No; it’s in the auto.”</p>

<p>“Better get it. I’ll take a rifle along. Bob, you
bring the rope. No telling what has happened, and
we may need all three.”</p>

<p>With rifle, revolver and rope the three boys
rushed into the forest to the rescue of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
friend. They could hear his shouts more plainly
now.</p>

<p>“Hurry or he’ll kill me!” cried the professor.</p>

<p>Running at top speed the boys emerged into a
sort of clearing. There they saw a sight that filled
them with terror.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass was standing underneath a
tree, from one of the lower branches of which a
big snake had dropped its sinuous folds about him.
The reptile was slowly winding its coils about the
unfortunate man, tightening and tightening them.
Its ugly head was within a few feet of the professor’s
face, and the man was striking at the snake
with the butterfly net.</p>

<p>“We’re coming! We’ll save you!” shouted
Jerry.</p>

<p>The boy started to run close to the naturalist, intending
to get near enough to fire at the snake’s
head without danger of hitting the professor.</p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled Bob, pointing to the ground
in front of the tree. “There’s another of the
reptiles!”</p>

<p>As he spoke a second snake reared its head from
the grass, right in the path Jerry would have taken.
Bob had warned him just in time.</p>

<p>Jerry dropped to one knee. He took quick but
careful aim at the snake on the ground and fired.
The reptile thrashed about in a death struggle, for
the bullet had crashed through its head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now for the other one!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>He ran in close to the reptile that was slowly
crushing the professor to death. The unfortunate
naturalist could no longer cry for help, so weak
was he.</p>

<p>Jerry placed the muzzle of the rifle close to the
snake’s head, and pulled the trigger. The ugly
folds relaxed, the long, sinuous body straightened
out and the professor would have fallen had not
Jerry, dropping his gun, caught him. The other
boys came to his aid, and they carried the naturalist
to one side and placed him on the grass.</p>

<p>Bringing water from a nearby spring, Bob soon
restored the professor to his senses.</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” said the collector in a few
minutes. “The breath was about squeezed out of
me, though.”</p>

<p>“You had a narrow escape,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Thanks to you boys, it ended fortunately,” said
the naturalist. “You see, I was trying to capture
a new kind of tree-toad, and I didn’t see the snake
until it had me in its folds. I’ll be more careful
next time.”</p>

<p>In a little while the professor was able to walk.
Jerry recovered his gun and the whole party made
their way back to the auto.</p>

<p>The camp utensils were soon packed up and the
journey was resumed.</p>

<p>“I wonder what sort of an inn we’ll stop at to-night?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
said Bob. “I hope they don’t have any
robbers.”</p>

<p>“We won’t run any chances,” spoke Ned. “We’ll
post a guard.”</p>

<p>For several hours the auto chugged along. As
it came to the top of a hill the boys saw below them
quite a good-sized village.</p>

<p>“There’s where we’ll spend the night,” remarked
Jerry. “Hello! What’s that?” and he
pointed to some object round a turn of the road,
just ahead of them.</p>

<p>“It looks like an automobile,” said the professor.</p>

<p>“It is!” cried Ned. “And Noddy Nixon is
in it!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />
<small>SOME TRICKS IN MAGIC.</small></h2>


<p>“You don’t mean it!” exclaimed the professor.
“Noddy Nixon, the young man who made all the
trouble for us! I thought we had seen the last
of him.”</p>

<p>“I hoped we had,” said Jerry. “But you can’t
always get what you want in this world.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! There is a purple grasshopper
I’ve been hunting for for nearly five years, and I
never found it!” spoke the naturalist.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Noddy saw us?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make much difference,” was Bob’s
opinion. “He’ll run across us sooner or later. If
he stops in the same village we do he’s sure to hear
about us.”</p>

<p>“Then we may as well put up overnight in this
town,” said Jerry, sending the machine ahead
again. Though the boys kept a close watch, they
saw no more of Noddy, for his automobile disappeared
around a turn of the road.</p>

<p>When the red touring car came up to the village,
such a crowd of curious Mexicans surrounded the
auto that the occupants had difficulty in descending.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess Noddy couldn’t have come here, or
these people wouldn’t be so curious about our car,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can depend on it, he’s somewhere in
the neighborhood,” was Ned’s opinion.</p>

<p>The keeper of the tavern, running out, bowed
low to the prospective guests.</p>

<p>“Enter, señors!” he exclaimed. “You are welcome
a thousand times. The whole place
is yours.”</p>

<p>“Will you guarantee that there are no robbers?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Robbers, señors? Not one of the rascals
within a thousand miles!”</p>

<p>“And will my bugs, snakes and specimens be
safe?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“Bugs and snakes! Santa Maria! What do
you want of such reptiles? Of course they will be
safe. The most wretched thief, of which there are
none here, would not so much as lay a finger on
them.”</p>

<p>“Then we will stay,” said the naturalist.</p>

<p>“Out of the way, dogs, cattle, swine, pigs and
beasts!” cried the innkeeper, brushing the crowd
aside. “Let the noble señors enter!”</p>

<p>At these words, spoken in fierce tones, though
mine host was smiling the while, the throng parted,
and the boys, accompanied by the professor, made
their way to the inn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not long before supper was served. There
were the frijoles and tortillas, without which no
Mexican meal of ordinary quality is complete, but
the adventurers had not yet become used to this
food. Then, too, there was delicious chocolate,
such as can be had nowhere but in Mexico.</p>

<p>While the meal was in progress the travelers
noticed that there was considerable excitement
about the inn. Crowds of people seemed to be
going and coming, all of them talking loudly, and
most of them laughing.</p>

<p>“What is it all about?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“To-day is a fête day,” replied the innkeeper.
“No one has worked, and to-night there is an entertainment
in the village square. Every one will
attend. It will be a grand sight.”</p>

<p>“What sort of entertainment?”</p>

<p>“I know only what I heard, that a most wonderful
magician will do feats. Ah, some of those
performers are very imps of darkness!” and the
man muttered a prayer beneath his breath.</p>

<p>“That sounds interesting. Let’s go,” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>“I haven’t any objection,” said Jerry. “Will
you go, Professor?”</p>

<p>“I will go anywhere where there is a chance I
may add to the stock of scientific knowledge,” replied
the naturalist. “Lead on, I’ll follow.”</p>

<p>The meal over, the boys and professor had only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to follow the crowd in order to reach the public
square. A centre space had been roped off, and
in the middle of this a small tent was erected.</p>

<p>On the payment of a small sum to some officials,
who seemed to be acting as ushers, the travelers
managed to get places in the front row. There
they stood, surrounded by swarthy Mexican men,
women and boys, waiting for the performance to
begin.</p>

<p>Suddenly from within the tent sounded some
weird music: the shrill scraping of fiddle and the
beat of tom-toms. Then a voice was heard chanting.
A few seconds later a young man, dressed
completely in white, stepped from the tent and sat
down, cross-legged, on the ground. A score of
flaring torches about him gave light, for it was now
night.</p>

<p>He spread a cloth on the ground, sprinkled a few
drops of water on it, muttered some words,
whisked away the covering, and there was a tiny
dwarfed tree, its branches bearing fruit.</p>

<p>“The old Indian mango trick!” exclaimed the
professor. “I have seen it done better, many
times.”</p>

<p>The next trick was more elaborate. The youth
in white clapped his hands and a boy came running
from the tent. With him he brought a basket.
The youth began to scold the boy, beating him with
a stick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>To escape the blows, the boy leaped into the
basket. In a trice the youth clapped the cover on.
Then drawing a sword at his side, the youth
plunged it into the wicker-work several times.
From the basket horrible cries came, growing
fainter and fainter at each thrust of the weapon.</p>

<p>With a cry of satisfaction the youth finally held
his sword aloft. The boys could see that it ran
red, as if with blood.</p>

<p>“Has he stabbed him?” asked Bob, in frightened
tones.</p>

<p>“Watch,” said the professor, with a smile.</p>

<p>The youth opened the basket. It was empty.
The boy had disappeared. The youth gave a cry
of astonishment, and gazed up into the starlit sky.
Naturally, every one in the crowd gazed upward,
likewise. All at once there was a cry from behind
the youth, and the boy who had been in the basket,
laughing and capering about as if being thrust
through with a sword was the biggest joke in the
world, moved among the assemblage, collecting
coins in his cap.</p>

<p>“Another old Indian trick,” said the professor.
“He simply curled up close to the outer rim of the
basket and the sword went through the middle,
where his body formed a circle.”</p>

<p>“But the blood!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“The boy had a sponge wet with red liquid, and
when the sword blade came through the basket he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
wiped the crimson stuff on it,” explained the professor.</p>

<p>The tricks seemed to please the crowd very
much, for few of them saw how they were done.
The Mexicans cried for more.</p>

<p>The youth and boy retired to the tent. Their
place was taken by an old man, wrapped in a cloak.
He produced a long rope, which he proceeded to
knot about his body, tying himself closely. Then
he signed for two of the spectators to take hold,
one at either end of the cord, which extended from
under his cloak. Two men did as he desired.</p>

<p>Then the old man began a sort of chant. He
waved his hands in the air. With a quick motion
he threw something at one of the torches. A cloud
of smoke arose. There was a wild cry from the
two men who held the rope. When the vapor
cleared away the magician was nowhere to be seen,
though his cloak lay on the ground and the men
still held the ends of the rope that had bound him.</p>

<p>An instant later there came a laugh from a tree
off to the left. Every one turned to look, and the
old man jumped down from among the branches.</p>

<p>“He tied fake knots,” said the professor.
“While he was waving his hands he managed to
undo them. Then he threw some powder in the
torch flame, and while the smoke blinded every
one he slipped out of his bonds and cloak, went
through the crowd like a snake, and climbed a tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
The tricks are nothing to what I have seen in Egypt
and India.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps there is nothing wonderful but in India
or Egypt,” spoke a voice at the professor’s elbow.
He turned with a start, to see the old
magician standing near him. The naturalist had
not spoken aloud, yet it seemed that the Mexican
had heard him.</p>

<p>“There are stranger things in this land than in
Egypt,” went on the trickster. “Buried cities are
stranger. Buried cities, where there is much gold
to be had and great riches.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about buried cities?” asked
the professor.</p>

<p>“Ask him who sat in the road, who drew the
circle in the dust. Ask him whom ye vainly
sought,” replied the Mexican, with a laugh.</p>

<p>The professor started.</p>

<p>“It can’t be! Yes, it is. It’s the same Mexican
we met before, and to whom I gave the tobacco,”
said the naturalist.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Si, señor</i>,” was the answer, as the old man
bowed low. “And be assured that though you
mock at my poor magic, yet I can look into the
future for you. I tell you,” and he leaned over
and whispered, “you shall soon find what you seek,
the mysterious city. You are on the right road.
Keep on. When ye reach a place where the path
turns to the left, at the sign where ye shall see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
laughing serpent, take that path. See, the stars
tell that you will meet with good fortune.”</p>

<p>With a dramatic gesture the old man pointed
aloft. Involuntarily the professor and the boys
looked up. Then, remembering the trick that had
been played on them before, they looked for the
Mexican. But he had disappeared.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />
<small>NODDY NIXON’S PLOT.</small></h2>


<p>“His old trick again,” murmured the professor.
“I should have been on my guard. However, it
doesn’t matter. But come on, boys. If we stand
out here our plans will soon be known to every
one.”</p>

<p>The travelers went back to their hotel, but the
crowds of people remained at the square, for there
were other antics of the entertainers to follow.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we’ll have to sleep ‘<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">en el sereno</i>’
to-night?” said Bob. “If we do, I’m going to stay
awake.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; if they treat Chunky the way they
did Jerry and myself, we’ll be stranded,” put in
Ned. “Have you got it all right, Chunky?”</p>

<p>What “it” was, Ned did not say; but Bob understood,
and, feeling where his money-belt encircled
his waist, nodded to indicate that it was still in
place.</p>

<p>The travelers found there was plenty of room
in the hotel. They were given a large apartment
with four beds in it, and told they could sleep there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
together. They found that the room had but one
door to it, and all the windows were too high up to
admit of easy entrance. So, building a barricade
of chairs in front of the portal, the adventurers
decided it would not be necessary to stand guard.
If any one came into the apartment he would have
to make noise enough to awaken the soundest
sleeper.</p>

<p>Thus protected, the travelers went to bed. Nor
were their slumbers disturbed by the advent of
any robbers. However, if they could have seen
what was taking place in a small hut on the outskirts
of the town, about midnight, they might not
have slept as peacefully.</p>

<p>Within a small adobe house, well concealed in
a grove of trees, five figures were grouped
around a table on which burned a candle stuck in
a bottle.</p>

<p>“I’ll make trouble for Jerry Hopkins and his
friends yet,” spoke a youth, pounding the table
with his fist.</p>

<p>“That’s what you’re always saying, Noddy
Nixon,” put in a man standing over in the shadow.</p>

<p>“Well, I mean it this time, Tom Dalsett. We’d
have put them out of business long ago if I’d had
my way.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to do this time?”
asked a lad, about Noddy’s age, whom, had the
Motor Boys seen him, they would have at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
known for Jack Pender, though he had become
quite stout and bronzed by his travels.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a plan,” went on Noddy. “I didn’t
come over to Mexico for nothing.”</p>

<p>“What do you s’pose they come for?” asked
Bill Berry, who was busy cleaning his revolver.</p>

<p>“To locate a silver mine, of course,” replied
Noddy. “Ain’t that so, Vasco?” and Nixon turned
to a slick-looking Mexican, who was rolling a cigarette.
The fellow was a halfbreed, having some
American blood in his veins.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Si, señor</i>,” was the reply. “Trust Vasco Bilette
for finding out things. I heard them talking
about a mine.”</p>

<p>“Of course; I told you so,” said Noddy.</p>

<p>The truth of it was that Bilette had heard nothing
of the sort, but thought it best to agree with
Noddy.</p>

<p>“I hope we have better luck getting in on this
mine than we did on their gold mine,” said Pender.</p>

<p>“Well, rather!” put in Dalsett.</p>

<p>“Leave it to me,” went on Noddy. “I have a
plan. And now do you fellows want to stay here
all night or travel in the auto?”</p>

<p>“Stay here,” murmured Bilette. “It is warm
and comfortable. One can smoke here.” Then, as
if that settled it, he rolled himself up in his blanket,
and, with a last puff on his cigarette, he went to
sleep on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>In a little while the others followed his example.
Bilette slept better than any one, for he seemed to
be used to the hordes of fleas that infested the hut.</p>

<p>As for Noddy, he awakened several times because
of the uncomfortableness of his bed. Finally
he got up and went out to sit up the rest of the
night on the cushioned seats of the automobile.</p>

<p>So far, the Nixon crowd had done nothing but
ride on a sort of pleasure trip through Mexico.
Noddy had managed to get some cash from home,
and, with what Dalsett obtained by gambling, they
managed to live.</p>

<p>Shortly after crossing the Rio Grande River,
Noddy had fallen in with a slick Mexican, Vasco
Bilette by name, and had added him to his party.
Bilette knew the country well, and was of considerable
assistance. He seemed to have no particular
occupation. Some evenings, when they would be
near a large town, he would disappear. He always
turned up in the morning with plenty of cash. How
he got it he never said.</p>

<p>But once he returned with a knife wound in the
hand, and again, limping slightly from a bullet in
the leg. From which it might be inferred that
Vasco used other than gentle and legitimate means
of making a livelihood. But Noddy’s crowd was
not one that asked embarrassing questions.</p>

<p>With no particular object in view, Noddy had
driven his car hither and thither. However, accidentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
hearing that Jerry and his friends had
come over into Mexico, Noddy determined to remain
in their vicinity, learn their plans, and, if
possible, thwart them to his own advantage.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the boys and the professor, soundly
sleeping at their inn, could not look into the future
and see the dangers they were to run, all because
of Noddy and his gang. If they could have, they
might have turned back.</p>

<p>Bright and early the next morning Professor
Snodgrass awoke. He looked out of the window,
saw that the sun was shining, and rejoiced that
the day was to be pleasant. Then he happened
to spy a new kind of a fly buzzing around the
room.</p>

<p>“Ah, I must have you!” exclaimed the naturalist,
unlimbering his insect net. “Easy now, easy!”</p>

<p>On tiptoes he began encircling the room after
the fly. The buzzer seemed in no mood to be
caught, and the professor made several ineffectual
attempts to ensnare it. Finally the insect lighted
on Bob’s nose, as the boy still slumbered.</p>

<p>“Now I have you!” the professor cried. He forgot
that Bob might have some feelings, and thinking
only of the rare fly, he brought the net down
smartly on Bob’s countenance.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! Robbers! Thieves!” shouted
the boy.</p>

<p>“Keep still! Don’t move! I have it now!” yelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the professor, gathering up his net with the fly in
it. “Ah, there you are, my little beauty!”</p>

<p>Ned and Jerry tumbled out of their beds, Ned
with his revolver ready in his hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought it was some one after my money-belt,”
said Bob, when his eyes were fully opened
and he saw the professor.</p>

<p>“Sorry to disturb you,” said the naturalist.
“But it’s in the interest of science, my dear
young friend, and science is no respecter of
persons.”</p>

<p>“Nor of my nose, either,” observed Bob, rubbing
his proboscis with a rueful countenance.</p>

<p>There came a loud pounding at the door.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“’Tis I, the landlord,” was the answer. “What
is it? Have the brigands come? Is the place on
fire? Why did the señor yell, as if some one had
stuck a knife into him?”</p>

<p>“It was only me,” called Bob. “The professor
caught a new kind of fly on my nose.”</p>

<p>“A fly! On your nose! <em lang="es" xml:lang="es">Diablo!</em> Those
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americanos</i>! They are crazy!” the innkeeper muttered
as he went away.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re up; I suppose we may as well stay
up,” said Ned, stretching and yawning. “My, but
I did sleep good!”</p>

<p>They all agreed that the night’s sleep had been a
restful one. They dressed, had breakfast, and, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
spite of the entreaties of the landlord to stay a
few days, they were soon on the road in the automobile.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to know we are on the right path,”
said the professor, after several miles had been
covered. “I only hope that old Mexican was not
joking with us.”</p>

<p>“What was that he said about turning to the
left?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We are to turn when we come to the place
where the laughing monkey is,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Serpent was what he said,” observed Jerry.
“The laughing serpent. I wonder what that can
be. I never saw a snake laugh.”</p>

<p>“It might be a figure of speech, or he may have
meant there is a stone image carved in that design
set up to mark a road,” spoke the professor. “However,
we shall see.”</p>

<p>Dinner was eaten in a little glade beside a small
brook, where some fish were caught. Then, while
the boys stretched out on the grass, the professor,
who was never idle, took a small rifle and said he
would go into the forest and see if he could not get
a few specimens.</p>

<p>“Look out for snakes!” called Ned.</p>

<p>“I will,” replied the naturalist, remembering his
former experience.</p>

<p>About an hour later, when Jerry was just beginning
to think it was time to start off, the stillness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of the forest was broken by a terrible and blood-curdling
yell.</p>

<p>“A tiger!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“There are no tigers here,” said Jerry. “But
it’s some wild beast!”</p>

<p>The yell was repeated. Then came a crashing
of the underbrush, followed by a wild call for help.</p>

<p>“That’s the professor!” cried Jerry, seizing his
rifle.</p>

<small>NODDY SCHEMES WITH MEXICANS.</small></h2>


<p>The boys crashed through the bushes and under
the low branches of trees in the direction of the
professor’s voice. They could hear him more
plainly now.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! Come quick!” the naturalist
cried.</p>

<p>The sight that met the boys’ eyes when they
came out into a little clearing of the forest was at
once calculated to amuse and alarm them. <a href="#image03">They
saw the professor clinging to the tail of a mountain
lion</a>, the beast being suspended over a low tree-limb,

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_90">THEY SAW THE PROFESSOR CLINGING TO THE TAIL OF A MOUNTAIN LION.</a></div>
</div>

<p>The infuriated beast was struggling and
wiggling to get free from the grip the professor
had of its tail. It snarled and growled, now and
then giving voice to a fierce roar, and endeavoring
to swing far enough back to bite or claw the
naturalist.</p>

<p>As for Professor Snodgrass, he was clinging to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the tail with both hands for dear life, and trying
to keep as far as possible away from the dangerous
teeth and claws of the lion.</p>

<p>“Let go!” yelled Jerry.</p>

<p>“I dare not!” shouted the professor. “If I do
the brute will fall to the ground and eat me up.
I can’t let go, and I can’t hold on much longer.
Hurry up, boys, and do something!”</p>

<p>“How did you get that way?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I’ll&mdash;tell&mdash;you&mdash;later!” panted the poor professor,
as he was swung clear from the ground by
a particularly energetic movement of the beast.
“Hurry! Hurry! The tail is slipping through
my fingers!”</p>

<p>In fact, this seemed to be the case, and the beast
was now nearer the ground, while the length of
tail the naturalist grasped was lessened.</p>

<p>The big cat-like creature suddenly began swinging
to and fro, like a pendulum. At each swing it
came closer and closer to the professor. All the
while it was spitting and snarling in a rage. Suddenly
the professor gave a yell louder than any he
had uttered.</p>

<p>“Ouch! He bit me that time!” he cried. “Hurry,
boys!”</p>

<p>The lads saw that the situation now had more
of seriousness than humor in it. Jerry crept up
close and, with cocked rifle, waited for a chance to
fire at the beast without hitting the professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>At that instant the lion made a strong, backward
swing, and its claws caught in the professor’s trousers.
The beast tried to sink its teeth in the naturalist’s
legs, but with a quick movement the professor
himself jumped back, and, with his own momentum
and that of the lion to aid him, he swung in
a complete circle around the limb of the tree, the
lion going with him, so their positions were exactly
reversed.</p>

<p>“Steady now! I have him!” called Jerry.</p>

<p>The change in the positions of man and beast
had given the boy the very opportunity he wanted.
The animal was now nearest to him. Quickly raising
the rifle, Jerry sent a bullet into the brute’s
head, following it up with two others. The lion,
with a last wild struggle to free itself, dangled
limply from the tree-limb, from which it was still
suspended by the professor’s hold on its tail.</p>

<p>Seeing that his enemy was dead, and could do
him no harm, the naturalist let go his grip and the
big cat fell in a heap on the ground.</p>

<p>“Once more you boys have saved my life,” said
the collector, as he mopped his brow, for his exertions
in trying to keep free from the beast had not
been easy.</p>

<p>“Are you bit much?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Nothing more than scratches,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“How in the world did you ever get in such a
scrape?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how it was,” answered the professor.
“You see, I was busy collecting bugs and
small reptiles, going from tree to tree. When I
came to this one I saw what I thought was a small,
yellow snake. I believed I had a fine prize.</p>

<p>“I approached without making a sound, and
when I was near enough I made a grab for what I
imagined was the snake. Instead, it turned out
to be the tail of the mountain lion, which dangled
from the limb, on which the beast was crouched.
All at once there was a terrible commotion.”</p>

<p>“I would say there was!” interrupted Ned. “We
heard it over where we were.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” resumed the professor. “Well,
as soon as I got the tail in my hands I found I had
made a mistake. It was then too late to let go,
so the only thing to do was to hold on. It was
rather a peculiar position to be in.”</p>

<p>“It certainly was,” said Jerry, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. Well, seeing that the only
thing to do was to keep my grip, I kept it and yelled
for help. I guess the lion was as badly scared as I
was first, when it felt me grab its tail. After it
found I wasn’t going to let go it got mad, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“It acted so, at any rate,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” went on the professor. “Well,
anyhow, I knew if I did let go I would be clawed
to pieces, so there I hung, like the man on the tail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of the mad bull, not daring to let go. Then you
came, and you know the rest.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you’re not hurt?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure,” was the reply. “I was too lively for the
lion. I’m sorry the tail didn’t turn out to be a
snake, though, for if it had been I’m sure it would
have been a rare specimen.”</p>

<p>Leaving the dead body of the animal where it
had fallen, the travelers went back to their auto.
The camp utensils were packed away, and soon,
with Ned at the steering wheel, the machine was
running off the miles that separated the adventurers
from the hidden city they hoped to find.</p>

<p>They traveled until nearly nightfall, and came
to no village or settlement. It began to look as if
they would have to camp in the open, when, just
as darkness was approaching, they came to a
small adobe hut in the midst of a sugar-cane plantation.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can stop here overnight,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p>An aged Mexican and his wife came to the door
of the cabin to see the strange fire-wagon pass.
Speaking to them in Spanish, the professor asked
if he and his companions could get beds for the
night. At first the man seemed to hesitate, but the
rattling of a few coins in Bob’s pockets soon
changed his mind, and he bade the travelers enter.</p>

<p>The woman quickly got a fairly good meal, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
then, after sitting about for an hour or so and talking
over the events of the day, the travelers sought
their beds. They found themselves in one apartment,
containing two small, cane couches, neither
one hardly big enough for a single occupant.</p>

<p>“However, it’s better than sleeping out of doors,
where the mosquitoes can carry you away,” said
Ned.</p>

<p>Contrary to their expectations, the travelers slept
good, the only trouble being the fleas, which were
particularly numerous. But by this time they had
become somewhat used to this Mexican pest.</p>

<p>While the professor and the boys were taking
a well-earned rest, quite a different scene was being
enacted by Noddy Nixon and his companions.</p>

<p>Following a half-formed plan he had in mind,
Noddy had hung on the trail of the Motor Boys.
He had followed them from the inn where they
last stopped, and now he was camped out, with his
followers, about five miles from the adobe hut.
But Jerry and his friends did not know this.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it pretty near time you told us what you
are going to do, Noddy?” asked Jack Pender, as
he piled some wood on the camp-fire.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” spoke Noddy. “We’re going to
follow them until they locate their mine, and then
we’re going to stake a claim right near theirs.
They’re not going to get all the gold or silver in
this country the way they did in Arizona.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you sure it’s a mine they’re after?” asked
Bilette, puffing at his cigarette.</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied Noddy. “What else could
it be? Didn’t you hear that’s what they came for?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” went on the slick Mexican. “I
only asked for information. If it’s a mine they’re
after we’ll need a bigger force than we have to run
things.”</p>

<p>“Where can we get help?” asked Noddy.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you,” replied Vasco. He put his
fingers to his lips and whistled shrilly.</p>

<p>An instant later half a dozen Mexicans stepped
from the shadow of the trees and stood in a line,
in the glare of the fire.</p>

<p>“Well, you didn’t lose any time over it,” observed
Noddy. “Where did they come from, and
who are they?” and the bully looked a little uneasy.</p>

<p>“They came from the greenwood,” replied
Vasco Bilette, “for the forest is their home. And
they are friends of mine, so now both your questions
are answered.”</p>

<p>“If they’re friends of yours I s’pose it’s all
right,” went on Noddy.</p>

<p>“Well, rather!” drawled Vasco, lighting another
cigarette from the stump of his last one.</p>

<p>“Will they help us?” went on Noddy.</p>

<p>Bilette addressed something in Spanish to his
friends who had so mysteriously appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Si, señor</i>,” they exclaimed as one man, bowing
to Noddy.</p>

<p>“Queer you happened to have ’em on hand,”
said Noddy, accepting the answer to his question,
for he had learned a little Spanish, and knew that
“si” meant yes.</p>

<p>“I anticipated we might need them,” said Bilette.
“So I told them to be on hand and in waiting
to-night. They are very prompt.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll join forces with them and show
Jerry Hopkins and his crowd that he can’t have
everything his own way,” growled Noddy. “Come
on, we’ll follow them now and see what they are
doing,” and Noddy seemed ready to start off.</p>

<p>“Not to-night; it’s time to turn in,” objected
Bilette. “We’ll begin early in the morning.”</p>

<p>He spoke once more to the six men, who disappeared
into the forest as quietly as they had come.
Then Bilette, wrapping himself up in his cloak,
went to sleep.</p>

<p>The others followed his example, and soon the
camp was quiet. Noddy now had his plans in
working order, and he thought, with satisfaction,
of the revenge he would have.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />
<small>ON THE TRAIL.</small></h2>


<p>“Come, come, boys! Are you going to sleep all
day?” exclaimed Professor Snodgrass, the next
morning.</p>

<p>His cheery voice awoke the others, and they sat
up on the hard cots.</p>

<p>“Where are we? Oh, yes, I remember now!”
said Bob. “I thought I was back at the gold mine.”</p>

<p>“I dreamed I was back in Cresville,” added
Jerry. “I wonder how all the folks are. We must
write some letters home.”</p>

<p>After breakfast, which the Mexican and his wife
served in an appetizing style, the travelers decided
to delay their start an hour or two, and spend the
time writing. Professor Snodgrass said he had no
one to correspond with, so he wandered off with
his net and specimen box, but the boys got out
paper, pens and ink, and were soon busy scratching
away.</p>

<p>In about two hours the professor returned,
having collected a number of specimens and escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
getting into any difficulties or dangers for
once.</p>

<p>“We’d better start,” he called. “I’m anxious
to get to that underground city. If that turns out
half as well as I expect, our fortunes are made.”</p>

<p>“Will it be better than the gold mine?” asked
Bob, with a grin.</p>

<p>“The gold mine!” exclaimed the naturalist.
“Why, I had rather reach this buried city than have
half a dozen gold mines!”</p>

<p>He was very enthusiastic and seemed anxious
to get on with the journey. The automobile was
made ready, and, bidding their hosts good-by, the
travelers were again under way.</p>

<p>As they progressed the road became rougher and
more difficult of passage. In places it was so narrow
that the automobile could barely be taken past
the thick growth of foliage on either side.</p>

<p>The forest fairly teemed with animal life, while
the flitting of brilliantly colored birds through the
trees made the woods look as if a rainbow had
burst and fallen from the sky. Parrots and macaws,
gay in their vari-tinted plumage, called
shrilly as the puffing auto invaded their domains.</p>

<p>It was necessary to run the car slowly. The professor
fretted at the lack of speed, but nothing
could be done about it, and, as Jerry said, it was
better to be slow and sure. So they went on for
several miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>About noon the travelers came to the edge of a
broad river, which cut in two the road they had
been following.</p>

<p>“Here’s a problem,” said Jerry, bringing the
car to a stop. “How are we going to get over
that? No bridge and no ferry in sight.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it isn’t as deep as it looks,” suggested
the professor.</p>

<p>“Tell you what!” exclaimed Ned. “We’ll all
go in for a swim and then we can tell whether it’s
too deep to run the auto across.”</p>

<p>His plan was voted a good one, and soon the
boys and Professor Snodgrass were splashing about
in the water. Their bath was a refreshing one. Incidentally,
Ned found out that he could wade
across, the stream in one place coming only to his
knees, while the bottom was of firm sand.</p>

<p>While the travelers were splashing about in the
cool water, they might not have felt so unconcerned
had they been able to look through the thick screen
of foliage on the bank of the stream, and see what
was taking place there.</p>

<p>Several dark-complexioned men, in company with
Vasco Bilette, had dismounted from their horses
and were watching the bathers.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad they decided to stop,” remarked
Vasco. “Our horses are tired from following their
trail. They will probably camp for the night on
the other bank, for they would be foolish to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
farther when they can find good water and
fodder.”</p>

<p>“You forget they do not have a horse to consider,”
spoke one of the Mexicans. “Their machine
does not eat.”</p>

<p>“No more it does,” said Bilette. “But they
cannot go much farther. If necessary, we can cross
the river and get at them.”</p>

<p>“Is that Noddy boy and his puff-puff carriage to
join us?” asked one of the crowd of Mexicans.</p>

<p>“That is the plan,” replied Vasco. “He thought
we could follow the trail on horses better than he
could in the automobile, because that makes a noise,
and those we are pursuing might hear it. So Noddy
has kept about five miles behind. As for us, you
know that we have been only a mile in the rear,
thanks to the slowness with which they had to run
their machine.</p>

<p>“Ah, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americanos</i> have finished their bath.
Here they come back,” went on Vasco, as the boys
and the professor began wading toward the shore,
near which they had left their auto.</p>

<p>Suddenly the professor set up a great splashing
and made a grab under the water.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it! I’ve got it!” he yelled, holding
something aloft.</p>

<p>“Got what?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“A rare specimen of the green-clawed crab,”
was the answer, and the naturalist held up to view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a wiggling crawfish. “It bit my big toe, but I
grabbed it before it got away. This was indeed a
profitable bath for me. That specimen is worth
one hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“If there are crabs in there I don’t see why there
aren’t fish,” spoke Ned. “I’m going to try, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Quickly dressing, he got out a line and hook,
cut a pole and, with a grasshopper for bait, threw
in. In three minutes he had landed a fine big fish,
and several others followed in succession.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have one good meal, anyhow,”
observed Ned.</p>

<p>“Shall we stay on this side and eat, or cross the
river?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“Might as well stay here,” was Jerry’s
opinion.</p>

<p>So the portable stove was made ready and soon
the appetizing smell of frying fish filled the air.
The travelers made a good meal, and Vasco Bilette
and his gang, hiding among the trees, smoked their
cigarettes and wished they had a portion.</p>

<p>“But never mind, when we have the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americanos</i>
at our mercy we will be the ones who eat, and they
will starve,” was how Vasco consoled himself.</p>

<p>Dinner over, the travelers took their places in
the auto, and, with Jerry at the wheel, the passage
of the river was begun. Following the course Ned
had tried, the machine was taken safely over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
stream, and run up the opposite bank. No sooner
had it got on solid ground, however, than, with a
loud noise, one of the rear tires burst.</p>

<p>“Here’s trouble!” exclaimed Ned, as Jerry
brought the car to a sudden stop.</p>

<p>“Might have been worse,” commented Bob. “It
might have blown out while we were in the water,
and that would have been no joke.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Chunky,” said Jerry. “Well, I
suppose we may as well camp here for a spell; at
least until the repairs are made.”</p>

<p>He set to work to put in a new tube, Ned and
Bob assisting him, while the professor wandered
off after any stray specimens that might exist.
He found several insects that he said were
rare ones.</p>

<p>The fixing of the tire proved a harder job than
Jerry had anticipated. It was several hours before
it was repaired to suit him, and by then the sun
was getting low.</p>

<p>“What do you say that we camp here for the
night?” proposed Ned. “We can’t get on much
farther anyhow, and this is a nice place. It’s more
open than in the forest.”</p>

<p>This was voted a good plan, so a fire was made
and a camp staked out. From their side of the
river Vasco and his companions viewed these preparations
with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“They cannot escape us now,” said the leader of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the Mexicans. “We can easily cross the river after
dark and get close to them. I wish Noddy would
hurry up.”</p>

<p>At that instant there was the sound of wheels in
the road, to the left of which Vasco and his men
were concealed. In a little while Noddy, with Dalsett,
Berry and Pender, rode up in the machine.</p>

<p>“Where are they?” asked Noddy, eagerly.</p>

<p>Vasco pointed through the screen of bushes to
the other side of the bank, where the professor and
boys were encamped.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Nixon. “We’ll pay them a
visit to-night.”</p>

<p>All unconscious of the nearness of their foes,
the Cresville boys, having had a good supper, sat
talking about the camp-fire. The professor was
engaged in sorting over the specimens he had gathered
during the day.</p>

<p>At this same time Noddy and Dalsett, with
Vasco and the six Mexicans the latter had provided,
were preparing to cross the river, under
cover of the darkness.</p>

<p>They did not undress, but waded in as they were,
the gleaming camp-fire on the other side serving as
a beacon to guide them.</p>

<p>“Softly!” cautioned Vasco, as the nine crawled
up on the opposite bank, and began creeping toward
the campers.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br />
<small>THE ANGRY MEXICANS.</small></h2>


<p>The professor and the boys were thinking of
getting out their blankets and turning in for the
night. They sat in a circle about the camp-fire,
talking over the events of the day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, creeping nearer and nearer, Noddy,
Vasco and their gang were encircling the camp of
Jerry and his friends. They came so close that
they could hear the conversation between the professor
and the boys.</p>

<p>Now, if the Mexicans whom Vasco had engaged
to assist him had not understood something of the
English language, or if chance had so arranged
matters that they had not come near enough to
overhear the talk of Jerry and his comrades, this
story might have had a different ending.</p>

<p>As it was, fate so willed matters that Noddy and
his gang got close to the camp in time to hear the
professor remark:</p>

<p>“Well, boys, it will not be many more days, I
hope, before we reach the buried city we are searching
for. And when we do I will be the proudest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
man in the world. Think of discovering a buried
town of ancient Mexico! Why, half the college
professors would give their heads to be in my
place.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t found the city yet,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“No; but I am sure we are on the right road,”
went on the professor. “I am sure of it, not only
because of what the old Mexican magician told us,
but from the map my friend left me. See, here it
is,” and he drew out the paper with the rude drawing
on.</p>

<p>The boys drew close to look the map over once
more.</p>

<p>“There seem to be two roads, one branching
off to the right,” remarked Jerry, pointing to the
map. “And it looks as if there was some sort of
an image at the parting of the ways.”</p>

<p>“There is!” exclaimed the professor. “I never
noticed it before, but there is the laughing serpent,
as sure as you’re a foot high!”</p>

<p>“We’ll reach the buried city all right,” spoke
Bob. “I only hope we don’t come upon it too unexpectedly.”</p>

<p>“Well, the Mexican prophesied we would find it
sooner than we thought,” observed Ned. “But he
may not have meant all he said. Anyhow, I’m
sleepy and I’m going to turn in.”</p>

<p>The others followed his example of wrapping
themselves up in their blankets, and soon their deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
breathing told they were on the road to slumberland.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Mexicans who had listened to
the above conversation were much disturbed.
Though they did not understand all that had been
said, they caught enough to indicate to them that
the boys and the professor were not on a search for
gold or silver mines, the only things in which the
Mexicans were interested.</p>

<p>There were angry but low-voiced mutterings
among the Mexicans. Soon they became angry,
talked among themselves and grew quite excited.
They talked rapidly to Vasco, in Spanish.</p>

<p>“What does all this mean, Noddy?” asked Bilette.
“Have you fooled us?”</p>

<p>“No, no, it’s all right!” exclaimed Nixon.
“Their talk of a buried city is only a bluff to throw
us off the track.”</p>

<p>“Hardly, when they don’t know we are following
them,” said Vasco. “I’m afraid that’s not true,
Noddy. Better own up and say you guessed at the
whole thing.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t guess!” exclaimed Noddy.</p>

<p>“Too much talk! Not enough do!” exclaimed
one of the Mexicans, striding forward and pushing
Noddy to one side. Noddy resented this, and drew
back his hand as if to strike the Mexican. The
latter, quick as a flash, drew an ugly-looking knife.</p>

<p>“Put that up!” exclaimed Vasco, noting, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
darkness, his companion’s act. “We don’t want to
begin fighting among ourselves.”</p>

<p>He stepped between Noddy and the Mexican,
and pushed them away from each other. The Mexican
muttered angrily, and his companions could be
heard growling over the outcome of the affair.
They could appreciate a gold or silver mine. A
buried city was nothing to them, and they saw no
use in pursuing the trail further. They were angry
at Noddy for having brought them thus far on a
foolish errand.</p>

<p>“Now keep quiet,” advised Bilette. “The first
thing you know you’ll have them all aroused and
then there’ll be trouble.”</p>

<p>“<em lang="es" xml:lang="es">Diablo!</em>” exclaimed one of the Mexicans, beneath
his breath. “Are we fools or children? We
leave the city and we travel for days through the
wilderness. We are told we are to get great riches.
Santa Maria! Is this money? Is this gold or silver?
The crazy <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americanos</i> talk of nothing but
lost cities. What care I for lost cities? What care
any of us for lost cities? I hate lost cities!”</p>

<p>“And I! And I!” exclaimed his companions, in
whispers.</p>

<p>“And this fellow, Noddy Nixon, is to blame for
it all!” went on the angry Mexican. “He gets us
all to come out here. We follow the crazy <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americano</i>
who does nothing but grab bugs and toads.
He is man to be afraid of! Yet we follow him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and all for what? To find he is looking for some
old ruins. I will not stand it!”</p>

<p>“Clear out of here!” commanded Bilette. “If
we stand here quarreling much longer they’ll wake
up.”</p>

<p>Under the guidance of their leader, the Mexicans
made their way back to the river bank. On
the opposite shore they had left their horses and
Noddy’s automobile.</p>

<p>“What made you think they were after a mine,
Noddy?” asked Bilette, when the party was well
beyond earshot of the campers. “You must have
made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Supposing I did,” whispered Noddy, in low
tones to Vasco, “what good will it do to tell every
one? I may have failed on this plan, but I have
another, even better.”</p>

<p>“Better not try it until you find if it will work,”
advised Bilette. “My men are in no mood to be
fooled a second time.”</p>

<p>Disappointed and dejected, the Mexicans recrossed
the river and made their camp on the opposite
shore from Professor Snodgrass and the boys.
The Mexicans were still in a surly mood, and Vasco
had to keep close watch lest some one of them
should harm Noddy.</p>

<p>Wet and cold, for if the days were hot the
nights were chilly, the Nixon gang reached their
camp. One of the men lighted a fire and cooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
some frijoles and tortillas. The meal, simple as
it was, made every one feel better.</p>

<p>Nixon and Pender, as soon as they had finished
eating, drew off to one side, leaving the Mexicans
to talk among themselves.</p>

<p>“It looks as if we’d have trouble,” said Noddy.</p>

<p>“It’s all your fault,” observed Pender.</p>

<p>“I’m not saying it isn’t,” put in Noddy. “But
what’s the use of crying over spilled milk? The
question is: What are we going to do about it
now?”</p>

<p>Pender was silent a few minutes. Then a
thought seemed to come to him suddenly.</p>

<p>“I have it!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Noddy.</p>

<p>Jack leaned over and whispered something in
his friend’s ear. Noddy hesitated a moment, and
then gave a start.</p>

<p>“The very thing!” he exclaimed. “I wonder I
didn’t think of it before.”</p>

<p>He hurried to where Vasco was sitting, near the
camp-fire, smoking a cigarette. To him he whispered
what Pender had suggested.</p>

<p>“It’s a risky thing to do,” said the Mexican.
“If it fails, we’ll have to leave the country. If it
succeeds we’ll be in danger of heavy punishment
from the authorities. However, I’m ready to risk
it if you are. Shall I tell the men?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied Noddy. “I want to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
it up to them for being mistaken about the
mine.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Vasco called his friends to him, and,
motioning for silence, said:</p>

<p>“Our friend Noddy,” he explained, “has just
told me something.”</p>

<p>“About a gold mine?” asked one of the men,
bitterly.</p>

<p>“It may prove to be a gold mine,” said Vasco.
“But it concerns one of those across the river,” and
he nodded toward the other campers.</p>

<p>“Did you notice one of the boys”&mdash;Bilette went
on&mdash;“the fat one; the stout youth; the one they
call Bob and sometimes Chunky?”</p>

<p>“<em lang="es" xml:lang="es">Si! Si!</em>” exclaimed the Mexicans.</p>

<p>“Well, his father is a rich banker.”</p>

<p>“What of it?” asked one of the men. “His
money is not in Mexico.”</p>

<p>“But it can be brought to Mexico!” cried Vasco.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“By kidnapping the boy and holding him for a
large ransom. Will you do it?”</p>

<p>“We will!” yelled the men. “This will provide
us with gold. We’ll kidnap the fat boy!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a><br />
<small>CAUGHT BY AN ALLIGATOR.</small></h2>


<p>“Easy! Easy!” cried Vasco Bilette. “Do
you want them to hear you across the river?”</p>

<p>Under his caution the men subsided.</p>

<p>“We must follow them and watch our chance,”
spoke Noddy. “We’ll demand a heavy ransom.”</p>

<p>“<em lang="es" xml:lang="es">Si! Si!</em>” agreed the Mexicans.</p>

<p>“That’s how we get square, Jack,” whispered
Noddy to his chum.</p>

<p>“You bet, Noddy; and get money, too!” said
Pender.</p>

<p>“We’ll all have to have a share,” put in Dalsett.
“I’m not here for my health.”</p>

<p>“Me either,” remarked Bill Berry. “I need
cash as much as any one.”</p>

<p>“We’ll share the ransom money,” said Vasco.
“Now turn in, every one of you.”</p>

<p>Soon the camp became quiet, the only sounds
heard being the movements of animals in the forest,
or, now and then, the splash of a fish in the
river.</p>

<p>The sun was scarcely above the horizon the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
morning ere Vasco Bilette was astir. He took a
position where he could watch the other camp, and
saw the professor and the boys get their breakfast
and start off.</p>

<p>“We’ll give them about an hour’s start,” said
Vasco to Noddy. “Then the men on horses will
follow and you can come, about a mile behind, in
the auto. At the first opportunity we’ll capture this
Bob Baker.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jerry and his companions were
going along at a moderate pace. The weather was
fine though hot, and the road fairly good. For
perhaps twenty miles they puffed along, and then
they came to another river.</p>

<p>“I hope this isn’t any deeper than the other,”
said Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’ll swim across,” volunteered Ned.</p>

<p>His offer was accepted, and, stripping off his
outer garments, he plunged into the water. Luckily,
he found the stream was about as shallow as the
first one the auto had forded. He reached the opposite
bank and called over.</p>

<p>“Come on! Fetch my clothes with you; I’m not
going to swim back.”</p>

<p>Jerry started the machine down into the water.
It went along all right until about half way across.
Then there came a sudden swirl beneath the surface,
a jar to the machine, and then the auto came
to a stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Jerry. “Have we
struck a snag?”</p>

<p>“Looks more like a snag had struck us,” replied
Bob, leaning over the rear seat and looking down
into the water. “Something has hold of one of
the back wheels.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Jerry. “Do you suppose
a fish would try to swallow an automobile, as
the whale did Jonah?”</p>

<p>“Well, you can see for yourself,” maintained
Bob. “There’s some kind of a fish, or beast, or
bird, down under the water, making quite a fuss.
It’s so muddy I can’t make out what it is.”</p>

<p>Jerry climbed over into the tonneau. Sure
enough, there was some disturbance going on.
Every now and then the water would swirl and
eddy, and the automobile would tremble as if trying
to move against some powerful force. Jerry
had thrown out the gears as soon as he felt an
obstruction.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass was closely observing the
water.</p>

<p>“What do you think it is?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“It might be that it is an eddy of the water
about a sink-hole, or it may be, as Bob suggests, a
big fish,” replied the naturalist. “I never knew
there were fish in these waters big enough to stop
an auto, though.”</p>

<p>“It may be a whole school of fishes,” said Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then there came a more violent agitation
of the water, and the auto began to move backward
slightly.</p>

<p>“Whatever it is, it seems bound to get us,”
Jerry remarked. “Wait until I see if I can’t beat
the fish or whatever it is.”</p>

<p>He turned on more power and threw in the first
speed gear. The auto shivered and trembled, and
then moved ahead slightly. But the big fish, or
whatever it was, with powerful strokes of its tail
began a backward pull that neutralized the action
of the automobile.</p>

<p>“I see what it is!” cried the professor.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“A big alligator! It has one wheel in its mouth
and is trying to drag us back. Hand me a
rifle!”</p>

<p>Jerry passed over a gun. The professor, who
was a good shot, leaned down over the back of the
tonneau. He could just make out the ugly head
of the ’gator beneath the surface. In quick succession
he sent three bullets from the magazine
rifle into its brain.</p>

<p>There was a last dying struggle of the beast,
the waters swirled in a whirlpool under the lashing
of the powerful tail, and then the little waves
became red with blood and the alligator ceased
struggling.</p>

<p>Once more Jerry threw the gear into place, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
this time the machine went forward and reached
the opposite bank.</p>

<p>“I thought you were never coming,” observed
Ned, who was shivering in his wet undergarments.
“What did you stop for? To catch fish?”</p>

<p>“We stopped because we had to,” replied Jerry,
and he told Ned about the alligator.</p>

<p>“I thought you were shooting bullfrogs,” observed
the swimmer as he got out some dry clothing.
“Say, if we told the folks at home that a
Mexican alligator tried to chew up an automobile,
I wonder what they’d say?”</p>

<p>“The beast must have been very hungry, or else
have taken us for an enemy,” remarked the professor.
“I wish I could have saved him for a
specimen. But I suppose it would have been a
bother to carry around.”</p>

<p>“I think it would,” agreed Jerry. “But now
we are safe, I must see if Mr. Alligator damaged
the machine any.”</p>

<p>He looked at the wheels where the saurian had
taken hold, but beyond the marks of the teeth of
the beast on the spokes and rim, no harm had been
done.</p>

<p>“Are we ready to go on now?” asked the professor,
when Ned had finished dressing.</p>

<p>“I’d like to take a dip in the river,” said Bob.
“It’s hot and dusty on the road, and we may not
get another chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think I’ll go in, too,” observed Jerry. “We
are in no hurry. Will you come along, professor?”</p>

<p>“No; I’ll watch you,” said the naturalist. He
sat down on the bank while Jerry and Chunky prepared
for a dip.</p>

<p>They splashed around in the water near shore
and had a good bath. Bob was swimming a little
farther out than was Jerry.</p>

<p>“Better stay near shore,” cautioned the professor.
“No telling when some alligators may be
along.”</p>

<p>At that instant Bob gave a cry. He struggled in
the water and gave a spring into the air.</p>

<p>“Something has stung me!” he cried.</p>

<p>Then he sank back, limp and unconscious, beneath
the waves.</p>

<p>“Hurry!” cried the professor. “Get him out,
Jerry, or he’ll be drowned!”</p>

<p>But Jerry had hurried to the rescue even before
the professor called. Reaching down under the
water he picked up his companion’s body, and, placing
it over his shoulder, waded to shore with it.
Bob was as limp as a rag.</p>

<p>“Is he killed?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I hope not,” replied the professor. “Still, he
had a narrow escape.”</p>

<p>“Did something bite him?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>The professor pointed to a small red mark on
Bob’s leg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“He received an electric shock,” said the naturalist.</p>

<p>“An electric shock?” echoed Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes; from the electric battery fish, or stinging
ray, as they are sometimes called. They can give
a severe shock, causing death under some circumstances,
it is said. But I guess it was a young one
that stung Bob. They are a fish,” the professor
went on to explain, “fitted by nature with a perfect
electric battery. I wish I had caught one for a
specimen.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of it at the time this one stung
me or I would have caught it for you,” said Bob,
suddenly opening his eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re better, are you?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” replied Bob. “It was quite a
jar at first.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” put in the professor. “However,
you got over it better than I expected you
would. I think we had better get out of the neighborhood
of this river. It seems unlucky.”</p>

<p>In a little while Bob was sufficiently recovered
to dress. Then, having delayed only to fill the
water tank of the auto from the stream, the travelers
resumed their journey.</p>

<p>They chugged along until nightfall, and having
reached no settlement, they camped in the open,
and made an early start the next day. It was about
noon when, having made a sudden turn of the road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
they came to a place where there was a parting of
the ways.</p>

<p>“I wonder which we shall take?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” cried Bob, suddenly, pointing
to something ahead.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a><br />
<small>THE LAUGHING SERPENT.</small></h2>


<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry, bringing the machine
up with a sudden jerk.</p>

<p>“See! There is the laughing serpent!” exclaimed
Bob.</p>

<p>“The laughing serpent?” inquired Ned. “What
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember what the old Mexican
said?” went on Bob. “Here is the parting of the
ways, and here is the image of the laughing serpent.”</p>

<p>“Sure enough!” agreed the professor. “It’s an
image cut out of stone, in the shape of a snake
laughing. Wonderful! Wonderful!”</p>

<p>Right at the fork of the road and about fifteen
feet from the automobile was the strange design.
It was rudely cut out of stone, a serpent twining
about a tree-trunk. There was nothing remarkable
in the image itself except for the quaint, laughing
expression the sculptor had managed to carve on
the mouth of the reptile.</p>

<p>“I wonder how it came here?” asked Jerry, getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
out of the car and going close for a better
look.</p>

<p>“Probably a relic of the Aztec race,” replied
the professor. “They were artists in their
way. This must be the image the old Mexican
mentioned. If it is I suppose we may as well follow
his advice and take the road to the left.”</p>

<p>“The road to the buried city,” put in Jerry.
“We must be close to it now.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that something sticking in the mouth of
the image?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It looks like a paper,” said Ned. “I’ll climb
up and see what it is.”</p>

<p>He scrambled up the stone tree-trunk, about
which the image of the laughing serpent was
twined. Reaching up, he took from the mouth of
the reptile a folded paper.</p>

<p>“What does it say?” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s written in some queer language; Spanish,
I guess,” replied Ned. “I can’t read it.”</p>

<p>“Bring it here,” said Professor Snodgrass. “Perhaps
I can make it out.”</p>

<p>The naturalist puzzled over the writing a few
minutes. Then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“It’s from our old friend, the Mexican magician.
He tells us to turn to the left, which is the same
advice he has given us before, and he adds that we
must beware of some sudden happening.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what he means by that?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Probably nothing,” answered the professor.
“But if something does happen, and he meets us
after it, he’ll be sure to say he warned us. It’s a
way those pretended wonder-workers have.”</p>

<p>“How do you suppose the note was placed
there?” inquired Bob. “We left the Mexican
many miles behind.”</p>

<p>“They are wonderful runners,” answered the
naturalist. “The magician may not have placed it
here himself, but he may have given it to a friend.
Perhaps there was a relay of runners, such as used
to exist among the ancient Mexicans to carry royal
messages. The old Mexican, who, somehow or
other, discovered our object in this country, probably
wanted to impress us with his abilities in the
mystifying line.”</p>

<p>The travelers spent a few minutes examining the
queer, carved serpent. There were no other evidences
of the existence of man at hand, and, except
for the two roads, there was nothing to be seen but
an almost unbroken forest. It was a wild part of
Mexico.</p>

<p>“Well, what are we going to do?” asked Jerry.
“Go on or stay here?”</p>

<p>“Go on, by all means,” said the professor.
“Why, we may be only a little way from the buried
city! Just think of it! There will be wealth untold
for us!”</p>

<p>“One thing puzzles me though,” observed Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it, Chunky?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“How are we going to know this buried city
when we come to it?”</p>

<p>“How?” came from Jerry. “Why, I suppose
there’ll be a railroad station, with the name of the
city on it. Or there may be trolley cars, so we can
ask the conductors if we are at the underground
town. Don’t you worry about knowing the place
when you get to it.”</p>

<p>“But if it’s underground, how are we going to
find it?” persisted Bob. “It isn’t like a mine, for
people who know the signs can tell where gold or
silver is hidden under the ground. But a city is
different.”</p>

<p>“I confess that question has been a puzzle to
me,” admitted Professor Snodgrass. “The only
thing to do is to keep on along this road until we
come to the place, or see some evidence that a
buried city is in the vicinity.”</p>

<p>“Forward, then!” cried Jerry, cranking up the
auto.</p>

<p>They all got into the car and, proceeding at a
slow speed, for the path was uncertain, started
down the road leading to the left.</p>

<p>But all this while Noddy Nixon and Vasco Bilette,
at the head of their two bands, had not been
idle. Noddy kept his auto going, and Vasco and
his Mexicans trotted along on horseback, drawing
nearer and nearer to the travelers ahead of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>It was about noon when the boys and the professor
had started away from the image of the
laughing serpent, and it was three hours later that
Vasco and his men came up to it.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed the Mexican, staring at the
carved stone. “I never saw you before, but you’re
not remarkable for beauty. I wonder what you’re
here for?”</p>

<p>He had never been in this part of Mexico before,
and it was like a new country to him.</p>

<p>“I wonder which way those chaps took?” asked
Vasco, dismounting from his horse. “It won’t
do for us to take the wrong trail.”</p>

<p>“See!” exclaimed one of the Mexicans, pointing
to where the tracks of the auto wheels could be
seen, imprinted in the dust of the way leading to
the left. “See! That way they go!”</p>

<p>“Sure enough they did, Petro!” remarked Vasco.
“You have sharp eyes. Well, we’ll just wait here
until Noddy comes up and sees how things are. I
shouldn’t wonder but what it would be time to close
in on ’em to-night. I’m getting tired of waiting.
I want some money.”</p>

<p>“So are we all tired!” exclaimed one of the gang,
speaking in Spanish, which was the language Vasco
always used save in talking to his English acquaintances.
“We want gold, and if the fat boy is to be
carried off and held for a ransom, the sooner the
better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have patience,” advised Vasco. “We’ll have
him quick enough. Wait until Noddy comes.”
Then he began to roll a cigarette, his example being
followed by all the others.</p>

<p>In about an hour Noddy, Pender, Dalsett and
Berry came up in the auto. A consultation was
held, and it was decided to have the horsemen follow
the party in front more closely.</p>

<p>“We’ll do the kidnapping to-night,” said Noddy.
“We’ll wait until they go into camp, because that’s
what they’ll have to do, for there are no inns down
here. We’ll be hiding in the bushes and at the
proper time we’ll grab Bob Baker and run.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Vasco. “My men were beginning
to get impatient.”</p>

<p>The plotters made a fire and prepared dinner.
Then the Mexicans got out their revolvers and
began cleaning them. Several also sharpened their
knives.</p>

<p>“Look here,” began Noddy, as he saw these
preparations, “there’s to be no killing, you know,
Vasco.”</p>

<p>“Killing! Bless you, of course not,” was the
reply, but Vasco winked one eye at Dalsett. “My
men are only seeing that their weapons do not get
rusty. Now, captain, we’re ready to start as soon
as you give the word.”</p>

<p>“Then you may as well begin now,” was Noddy’s
reply. “They have a pretty good start of us, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
we’ll travel after dark, if need be, to catch up with
them. As soon as they camp out for the night,
Vasco, surround them so they can’t escape. Then
I’ll come up in my car, and we’ll take Bob away in
it.”</p>

<p>The horsemen started off, Noddy following in a
little while. The trail made by the auto of the
boys and the professor was easily followed.</p>

<p>Noddy’s car had barely turned around a bend in
the road before something strange happened. The
laughing serpent seemed to tremble and shake.
It appeared alive, and about to fall to the ground.</p>

<p>Then a portion of the base and tree-trunk slid
to one side and from the interior, which was hollow,
there stepped out an old Mexican&mdash;the same
who had played the part of the magician and who
had given prophetic warning to the travelers.</p>

<p>“Ha! My trick worked!” he exclaimed. “It
was a hard journey to travel all that distance and
get here ahead of them. Only the fleetness of my
horse and the fact that I knew all the roads that
were short cuts, enabled me to do it. Now for the
final act in the game!”</p>

<p>He placed his fingers to his mouth and blew a
shrill whistle. In an instant a milk-white horse
came from the bushes, where it had been concealed.</p>

<p>“Here, my beauty!” called the Mexican.</p>

<p>He leaped on the animal’s back and dashed off
like the wind, down the road leading to the right.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a><br />
<small>AN INTERRUPTED KIDNAPPING.</small></h2>


<p>As the auto containing the naturalist and the
boys progressed, the road became more and more
difficult to travel. Part of the way was overgrown
with brush, and several times the travelers had to
stop, get out and cut big vines that grew across the
path.</p>

<p>“I guess there hasn’t been much going on along
this highway,” observed Jerry.</p>

<p>“And I don’t believe it will ever be much in
favor with autoists,” said Ned. “There’s too
much sand.”</p>

<p>There was a great deal of the fine dirt and in
some places it was so soft and yielding that the
wheels of the car sank down half way to the hubs,
making it impossible to proceed except at a snail’s
pace. Then, again, would come firm stretches,
where the going was easier.</p>

<p>In this manner several miles were traversed.
The forest on either side of the road became more
dense and wilder. Thousands of parrots and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
birds flew about among the trees, and troops of
monkeys followed the progress of the automobile,
chattering as if in rage at the invasion of their
stamping ground.</p>

<p>Suddenly the screams and chattering of the
monkeys ceased. The birds also stopped their
racket, and the silence was weird after the riot of
noise. Then there came such a series of shrill
shrieks from a band of monkeys that it was evident
something out of the ordinary had happened.</p>

<p>The next instant a long, lithe, yellow animal shot
across the road in front of the auto. <a href="#image01">The big beast
had a monkey in its mouth.</a></p>

<p>“A jaguar!” exclaimed the professor. “Quick,
boys! Get the rifle!”</p>

<p>Ned handed the weapon to the professor, who
fired three times, quickly, but the jaguar leaped on,
unharmed.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re getting into the region of big
game,” remarked the naturalist, “and we’ll have to
be on the lookout now or some of the beasts will
be trying that trick on us.”</p>

<p>“The monkeys must have seen him; that’s
why they kept so still that time,” remarked
Bob.</p>

<p>“But it didn’t do that particular one any good,”
said the professor. “He must have been caught
napping. Well, Mr. Jaguar will have a good supper
to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“That reminds me,” spoke Bob. “When are
we going to eat?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, speak of eating and you’ll be sure
to hear from Chunky,” said Jerry. “But I suppose
we’ll have to camp pretty soon. It’s five
o’clock and there don’t seem to be any hotels in
the vicinity,” and he glanced at the dense forest on
every side and grinned.</p>

<p>“We’ll camp at the next clearing,” said the professor.
“Better get to a place where there’s a little
space on every side of you when there are wild
animals about.”</p>

<p>A mile further on the travelers came to a place
where the trees were less thick. There was an
open space on either side of the road. The auto
was placed under the shelter of a wide-spreading
palm and then the adventurers busied themselves
getting supper.</p>

<p>The professor took a gun and went a little way
into the woods. He shot a small deer, and in a
little while some choice venison steaks were broiling
over the camp stove.</p>

<p>“This is something like eating,” remarked Ned.
“I was getting tired of those frijoles, eggs and tortillas,”
and he accepted a second helping of
venison.</p>

<p>The rubber and woolen blankets were taken
from the auto, and the travelers prepared to spend
the night in the forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess we’ll mount guard,” said the professor.
“The forest is full of jaguars. I saw three while I
was hunting the deer.”</p>

<p>“Let me stay up,” begged Jerry. “I’m not
sleepy, and I’d like to get a shot at one of the
beasts.”</p>

<p>Ned also wanted to remain up, but the professor
said he could take the second watch; and, content
with this, Ned turned in with the others.</p>

<p>As the night wore on the forests resounded more
and more with the noises made by wild beasts.
The howls of the foxes mingled with the more terrifying
yells of the jaguars, and of the latter beasts
the woods seemed to be full.</p>

<p>Jerry, with the loaded magazine rifle, was on the
alert. He kept up a bright fire, for he knew that
unless made desperate by hunger no wild thing
would approach a flame. There were queer rustlings
and cracklings of the underbrush on every
side of the sentinel. Now and then through the
leaves he caught glimpses of reddish-green eyes
reflecting back the shine of the blaze.</p>

<p>Following the plans they had made, Vasco Bilette
and his Mexicans, together with Noddy and
the crowd in the automobile, had trailed the boys
and the professor to the camp. With great caution,
Vasco had led his men to within a short distance
of the fire Jerry had kindled, and Noddy’s
auto was in readiness for the kidnapping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>So, though Jerry did not know it, there were the
eyes of dangerous men on his movements as well as
the eyes of dangerous beasts.</p>

<p>Like dark shadows, the Mexicans slowly encircled
the camp. They were so close they could distinguish
the sleeping forms.</p>

<p>“Which is Bob?” whispered Vasco to Noddy.</p>

<p>“That one right at the foot of the big palm
tree,” replied Noddy Nixon, pointing out the
banker’s son.</p>

<p>“Is everything ready?” the leader of the Mexicans
asked.</p>

<p>“All ready!” replied Noddy.</p>

<p>Vasco was about to steal forward, hoping to be
able to grab up Bob and make off with him before
the camp was aroused. In case of resistance, he
had given his men orders to shoot.</p>

<p>But at that instant a big jaguar, driven wild with
hunger, and braving all danger, had crept to within
a few feet of Jerry. The animal smelled the meat
of the recently killed deer, the carcass of which
hung in a tree. The fierce beast determined to get
a meal at all hazards. It crouched on the limb of
a tree, just above Jerry’s head, ready for a spring
at the body of the deer.</p>

<p>Jerry happened to glance up. He saw the long,
lithe body, tense for a leap, the reddish-green eyes
glaring at him. Jerry was not a coward, but the
sight of the brute, so dangerous and so close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
him, scared him greatly for a second or two. Then,
recovering his nerve, he raised the rifle, took quick
aim and fired three shots in rapid succession.</p>

<p>With a snarl and roar the jaguar toppled to the
ground, tearing up the earth and leaves in a death
struggle.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” called out the professor.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Jerry?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>Bob, too, roused up, and the whole camp was
soon astir, every one grabbing a gun or revolver.
Jerry fired two more shots into the jaguar, and
the struggles ceased.</p>

<p>“I got him just in time,” he remarked.</p>

<p>The others crowded around the brute.</p>

<p>“Halt!” exclaimed Bilette, under his breath, as,
ready with his men to rush on the camp, he saw
that his plan was spoiled. “If it had not been for
that jaguar I would have had the captive. Come,
we must get out of this!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a><br />
<small>THE UNDERGROUND CITY.</small></h2>


<p>Vasco Bilette’s warning was received with ill
humor by his men. They were angry because the
kidnapping had not succeeded, and because the
jaguar had alarmed the camp and put every one on
guard.</p>

<p>“Come, let us give them battle now and take the
boy!” suggested one.</p>

<p>“Do you want to be killed?” asked Vasco, angrily.
“They are all armed now, and would shoot
at the least suspicious sound. I, for one, don’t care
to have a bullet in me. Come, let us get out of
this.”</p>

<p>The Mexicans saw the force of Vasco’s arguments.
They did not care about being shot at like
wild beasts, and they knew that the boys and the
professor were ready for anything now.</p>

<p>“We will try to-morrow night,” said Bilette, as,
with Noddy and his men, he silently withdrew to
where the horses and auto had been left. “Perhaps
we’ll have better luck then.”</p>

<p>The men growled, but had to accept the situation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
As for our friends, they were too excited to
sleep any more that night, and so they sat around
the camp-fire and talked until morning.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, camp was broken, and once more
the auto started on the trip toward the hidden city.
Professor Snodgrass got out the map made by his
dead friend and studied it carefully.</p>

<p>“I believe we are on the right road,” the naturalist
said. “Here is a highway marked on the
drawing that seems to correspond with the one we
are on. And there is a place marked where two
roads diverge. Only there is nothing said about
the laughing serpent, though there is something
here that might be taken for it,” and he pointed
to the map.</p>

<p>Every one was becoming quite anxious, and the
boys, as well as the professor, kept close watch
on each foot of the way to see if there were any
indications that they were close to the underground
town.</p>

<p>They stopped for dinner near a little brook, in
which Bob caught several fish that made a welcome
addition to the bill of fare.</p>

<p>“Now, if you boys don’t object, I think I’ll take
a little stroll into the woods and see what I can find
in the way of specimens,” remarked the naturalist,
as he finished the last of his fish and frijoles.</p>

<p>“Better take a gun along,” called Ned. “A
jaguar may get you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not going very far,” replied the professor.
“All I want is my net and box,” and with these
only he started off.</p>

<p>It was about an hour later when Jerry observed:</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it seem as if the monkeys were making
more noise than usual?”</p>

<p>The boys listened for a few seconds. It was evident
that something had disturbed these nimble
inhabitants of the forest, for they were yelling and
chattering at a great rate.</p>

<p>“Maybe another jaguar is after them,” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>“No; it doesn’t sound like that,” said Jerry.
“They seem to be yelling more in rage than in
fear.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re having a fight,” put in Ned.</p>

<p>Just then there came a crashing, as if several
trees were being crashed down by a tornado. There
was a crackling of the underbrush and a rustling
in the leaves. Then, above this noise and the yells
of the monkeys, sounded a single cry:</p>

<p>“Help, boys!”</p>

<p>“The professor’s in trouble again!” cried Jerry.
“I wonder what it is this time?”</p>

<p>Grabbing up a rifle, which example Bob and
Ned imitated, Jerry ran in the direction of the
voice. The noise made by the monkeys increased,
and there were sounds as if a bombardment of the
forest was under way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where are you?” called Jerry. “We are
coming!”</p>

<p>“Under this big rock!” called the professor, and
the boys, looking in the direction his voice came
from, saw the naturalist hiding under a big ledge
of stone that jutted out of the side of a hill in a
sort of a clearing.</p>

<p>“Can’t you come out?” called Ned.</p>

<p>“I tried to several times, but I was nearly
killed,” replied the professor. “The monkeys are
after me. Look at the ground.”</p>

<p>The boys looked and saw, strewn in front of the
shallow cave in which the professor had ensconced
himself, a number of round, dark objects. As they
looked there came a shower of others through the
air. Several of them hit on the rock, broke, and a
shower of white scattered all about.</p>

<p>“What in the world are they?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>He ran toward the professor. No sooner had he
emerged out of the dense forest into the clearing
than a regular hail of the round objects fell all
about him. One struck him on the shoulder and
the boy was glad enough to retreat.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“The monkeys are bombarding the professor
with cocoanuts,” said Bob, gasping for breath after
his run.</p>

<p>“Cocoanuts?”</p>

<p>“That’s what they are. Here come some more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken before the air was again
dark with the brown nuts, which were much larger
than those seen in market, being contained in their
original husk. At the same time there was a chorus
of angry cries from the monkeys.</p>

<p>It was evident now why the professor dared not
leave his rock shelter. The minute he did so he
would run the risk of being struck down and probably
killed by a volley of the nuts. Nor could the
boys go to his rescue, for the moment they crossed
the clearing they would be targets for the infuriated
animals.</p>

<p>“What’s to be done?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Supposing we shoot some of the monkeys,”
suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that would be a good idea,” said
Jerry. “In the first place if we kill any of the
animals it will make the others all the angrier.
And then we would have to keep shooting for several
days to make much of an inroad on the beasts.
There must be five thousand of them.”</p>

<p>Indeed, the forest was full of the long-tailed and
nimble-fingered monkeys, all perched in cocoanut
or other trees, ready to resent the slightest movement
on the part of their human enemies.</p>

<p>“I know a good trick,” spoke Bob.</p>

<p>“What is it, Chunky?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Take a big looking-glass and put it on a tree.
The monkeys will be attracted by the shine of it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
they will all go down to see what it is and when
they see a strange monkey in the glass they will
fight. That will make enough fuss so that the professor
can escape.”</p>

<p>“That might be a good trick if we had the big
mirror, which we haven’t,” spoke Jerry. “You’ll
have to think of something else, Chunky.”</p>

<p>But there was no need of this, for at that instant
the cries of the monkeys ceased. The silence was
almost oppressive in its suddenness and by contrast
with the previous riot of noise. Then came
unmistakable screams of fear from the simians.</p>

<p>“Now what has happened, I wonder?” said
Ned.</p>

<p>“It’s a jaguar!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>He pointed to a tree, on a limb of which one of
the animals the monkeys dreaded so much was
stretched out. The beast was stalking one of the
chattering animals, but his presence had been discovered
by the whole tribe.</p>

<p>So much in awe did the monkeys hold this
scourge of the Mexican forests that his presence
accomplished what the boys could never hope to.
The apes trooped off with a rush, chattering in
fright. With a howl of rage the jaguar took after
them.</p>

<p>“You can come out now, Professor,” called Ned.
“The monkeys are gone.”</p>

<p>In fear and trembling the naturalist came from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
his sheltering rock. He seemed in momentary fear
lest he might be greeted with a shower of the nuts,
but none fell. With rapid strides he crossed the
clearing and joined the boys.</p>

<p>“How did it all happen?” asked Jerry, as soon
as the professor had recovered his breath.</p>

<p>“It was all my fault,” explained the naturalist.
“I was collecting some butterfly specimens, when
I happened to see some monkeys in the cocoanut
trees. I had read that if any one threw something
at the beasts they would retaliate by throwing down
cocoanuts. I wanted to test it, so I threw a few
stones at the monkeys. They returned my fire with
interest, so I was forced to run under the rock for
shelter.</p>

<p>“There were only a few monkeys at first, but
more came until there were thousands. They kept
throwing cocoanuts until the ground was covered.
It’s lucky you came when I called.”</p>

<p>“It’s luckier the jaguar came along when he
did,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Let’s get back to the auto before I get into
any more trouble,” suggested the professor. “I
do seem to have the worst luck of getting into
scrapes.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later the travelers were on their
way. It was getting well along into afternoon and
they were beginning to think of where they would
spend the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>They were getting deeper and deeper into the
forest, and the way became more and more difficult
to travel. But they would not turn back, for
they felt they were on the right path.</p>

<p>At length they came to a place where creepers
and vines were so closely grown across the path that
nothing short of hatchets could make a way. The
boys got out the small axes kept for such emergencies,
and, after an hour’s work, made a passage.</p>

<p>They started forward once more, and were going
along at a pretty good clip, the road having improved
in spots.</p>

<p>“I wonder when we’ll get to that underground
city?” said Ned, for perhaps the tenth time that
day.</p>

<p>He had no sooner spoken than the earth trembled
under the auto. The machine seemed to stand
still. Then, with a sickening motion it plunged
forward and downward.</p>

<p>A big hole had opened in the road and let the
car and its occupants through the surface of the
earth. The machine slid forward, revealing, near
the top of a shaft, a brief glimpse of several ruined
buildings.</p>

<p>“It is the underground city!” exclaimed the professor.</p>

<p>Then there came intense darkness.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a><br />
<small>IN AN ANCIENT TEMPLE.</small></h2>


<p>The auto seemed to be bumping along downhill,
for at the first evidence of danger Jerry had shut
off the power and applied the brake. But the descent
was too steep to have the bands hold.</p>

<p>Down and down the adventurers went, through
some underground passage, it was evident.</p>

<p>“Are we all here?” called Jerry, his voice sounding
strange and muffled in the chamber to which
they had come.</p>

<p>“I’m here and all right, but I don’t exactly know
what has happened,” replied the professor.</p>

<p>“The same with me,” put in Ned, and Bob echoed
his words.</p>

<p>Just then the automobile came to a stop, having
reached a level and run along it for a short distance.</p>

<p>“Well, we seem to have arrived,” went on Jerry.
“I wonder how much good it is going to do us?”</p>

<p>“Supposing we light the search-lamp and see
what sort of a place we are in,” suggested Professor
Snodgrass. “It’s so dark in here we might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
just as well be inside one of the pyramids of
Egypt.”</p>

<p>The acetylene gas lamp on the front of the auto
was lighted, and in its brilliant rays the travelers
saw that they were in a large underground passage.
It was about twenty feet high, twice as broad and
seemed to be hewn out of solid rock.</p>

<p>“This is what makes it so dark,” observed the
professor. “I knew it must be something like this,
for it was still daylight when we tumbled into the
hole and we haven’t been five minutes down here.
Run the auto forward, Jerry.”</p>

<p>The car puffed slowly along surely as strange a
place as ever an automobile was in. The boys
looked eagerly ahead. They saw nothing but
the rocky sides and roof of the passage.</p>

<p>“This doesn’t look much like an underground
city,” objected Ned. “I think it’s an abandoned
railway tunnel.”</p>

<p>At that instant Jerry shut off the power and applied
the brakes with a jerk.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“There’s some sort of a wall or obstruction
ahead,” was the answer, and Jerry pointed to
where, in the glare of the lamp, could be seen a
wall that closed up the passageway completely.</p>

<p>“I guess this is the end,” remarked Ned, ruefully.</p>

<p>The naturalist got out of the car and ran forward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
He seemed to be examining the obstruction
carefully. He struck it two or three blows.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” he cried. “Come on, boys, this is
only a big wooden door! We can open it!”</p>

<p>In an instant the three lads had joined him. They
found that the passage was closed by a big portal of
planks, bolted together and swinging on immense
hinges. There was also a huge lock or fastening.</p>

<p>“Can we open the door?” inquired Bob. “It
looks as if it was meant to stay shut.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>He ran back to the automobile and got a kit of
tools. Then, while Ned held up one of the small
oil lamps that was taken off the dashboard of the
car, Jerry tackled the lock. It was a massive affair,
but time had so rusted it that very little
trouble was found in taking it apart so that the
door was free.</p>

<p>“Everybody push, now!” called Jerry. “Those
hinges are pretty rusty.”</p>

<p>They shoved with all their strength, but the
door, though it gave slightly, showing that no more
locks held it, would not open. It had probably
not been used for centuries.</p>

<p>“Looks as if we’d have to stay here,” said the
professor.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” spoke Jerry. “Wait a minute.”</p>

<p>He ran back to the auto, and soon the others
heard him cranking it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look out! Stand to one side!” he called.</p>

<p>The auto came forward slowly. Jerry steered
the front part of it carefully against the massive
door. Once he was close to the portal he turned
on full power.</p>

<p>There was a cracking and splintering of wood,
and a squeaking as the rusty hinges gave. Then,
with the auto pushing against it, the massive door
swung to one side. The machine had accomplished
what the strength of the boys and the professor
could not.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely the portal opened. Wider and
wider it swung, until there burst on the astonished
gaze of the travelers a flood of light. The sun
was shining overhead, though fast declining in the
west, but in the bright glare of the slanting beams
there was revealed the underground city.</p>

<p>There it stood in all its ancient splendor, most
of it, however, but mere ruins of what had been
fine buildings. There were rows and rows of
houses, stone palaces and what had been beautiful
temples. Nearly all of the structures showed traces
of elaborate carvings.</p>

<p>But ruin was on every side. The roofs of
houses, temples and palaces had fallen in. Walls
were crumbling and the streets were filled with debris.
As the boys looked, some foxes scampered
among the ruins, and shortly afterward a jaguar
slunk along, crawling into a hole in a temple wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Grand! Beautiful! Solemn!” exclaimed the
professor, in raptures over the discovery. “It is
more than I dared to hope for. Think of it, boys!
We have at last discovered the buried city of ancient
Mexico. How the people back in civilization
will open their eyes when they hear this news! My
name and yours as well will be covered with glory.
Oh, it is marvelous!”</p>

<p>“I guess it will be some time before the people
back in Cresville hear of this,” observed Jerry.
“There doesn’t seem to be any way of sending a
letter from here. I don’t see any telegraph station,
and there’s not a messenger boy in sight.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” said Ned. “You’d think a
buried city, a dead one, so to speak, would be just
the place where a district messenger would like to
come to rest.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lonesome place here,” remarked Bob. “I
hope we’ll find some one to talk to.”</p>

<p>“That’s just the beauty of the place,” said the
professor. “What good would an ancient, ruined,
buried city be if people were living in it? I hope
there isn’t a soul here but ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll get your desire, all right,” remarked
Jerry.</p>

<p>The first surprise and wonder over, the travelers
advanced a little way into the city and looked
about them. They saw that the place, which was
several miles square, was down in a hollow, formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of high hills. For this reason the location of the
city had remained so long a secret. They had come
upon it through one of the underground passages
leading into the town, and these, as they afterward
learned, were the only means of entering the place.
There were four of these passages or tunnels, one
entering from each side of the city, north, south,
east and west.</p>

<p>But time and change had closed up the outer
ends of the tunnels after the city had become deserted,
and it remained for Professor Snodgrass
and his party to tumble in on one.</p>

<p>It was as if a city had been built inside an immense
bowl and on the bottom of it. The sides
of the bowl would represent the hills and mountains
that girt the ancient town. Then, if four
holes were made in the sides of the vessel, close to
the bottom, they would be like the four entrances
to the old city.</p>

<p>“Supposing we take a ride through the town
before dark,” suggested Jerry. “We may meet
some one.”</p>

<p>He started the machine, but after going a short
distance it was found that it was impracticable to
use the machine to any advantage. The streets
were filled with debris and big stones from the
ruined houses and fallen hills, and it needed constant
twisting and turning to make the journey.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out and walk,” proposed Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then there’s a good place to leave the machine,”
said Bob, pointing to a ruined temple on
the left. “We can run it right inside, through the
big doors. It’s a regular garage.”</p>

<p>The suggestion was voted a good one, and Jerry
steered the auto into the temple. The place had
been magnificent in its day. Even now the walls
were covered with beautiful paintings, or the remains
of them, and the whole interior and exterior
of the place was a mass of fine stone carving.</p>

<p>The roof had fallen away in several places, but
there were spots where enough remained to give
shelter. The machine was run into a covered corner
and then the travelers went outside.</p>

<p>The professor uttered cries of delight at every
step, as he discovered some new specimen or relic.
They seemed to exist on every side.</p>

<p>“Look out where you’re stepping!” called the
naturalist, suddenly, as Jerry was about to set his
foot down.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter&mdash;a snake?” asked the boy,
jumping back.</p>

<p>“No. But you nearly stepped on and ruined a
petrified bug worth thousands of dollars!”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! I’ll be careful after this,” promised
Jerry, as the professor picked up the specimen
of a beetle and put it in his box.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a><br />
<small>MYSTERIOUS HAPPENINGS.</small></h2>


<p>The travelers strolled for some time longer, the
professor finding what he called rare relics at every
turn.</p>

<p>“This is like another gold mine,” he said.
“There are treasures untold here. I have no doubt
we will find a store of diamonds and other precious
stones before we are through.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to find a ham sandwich right now,”
observed Bob.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be Chunky if he wasn’t hungry,”
laughed Ned. “But I admit I feel somewhat the
same way myself.”</p>

<p>“Then we had better go back to the temple and
get supper,” advised Jerry.</p>

<p>So back they went, but their progress was slow,
because the professor would insist on examining
every bit of ruins he came to in order to see if there
were not specimens to be gathered or relics to be
picked up. His green box was full to overflowing
and all his pockets bulged, but he was the happiest
of naturalists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>It was dark when they reached the ancient place
of worship where the auto had been left, and at
Jerry’s suggestion Bob lighted the search-lamp and
the other two lights on the machine. This made a
brilliant circle of illumination in one place, but
threw the rest of the temple into a dense blackness.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to be here all alone,” remarked
Bob, looking about and shuddering a bit.</p>

<p>“Why, Chunky? Afraid of ghosts?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“What was that?” exclaimed Bob, suddenly,
starting at a noise.</p>

<p>“A bat,” replied the naturalist. “The place
is full of them. I must get some for specimens.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but what I prefer ghosts to bats,”
said Bob. “I hope none of them suck our blood
while we’re asleep.”</p>

<p>“No danger; I guess none of these are of the
vampire variety,” remarked the professor. “But
now let’s get supper.”</p>

<p>In spite of the strangeness of the surroundings,
the travelers managed to make a good meal. The
gasolene stove was set up and some canned chicken
prepared, with tortillas and frijoles.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to replenish our larder soon,” remarked
Jerry, looking into the provision chest.
“There’s only a little stuff left.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to go hunting some day,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
professor. “We can’t starve in this country. Game
is too plentiful.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if the people who built this place
didn’t put some bedrooms in it,” said Bob, as, sitting
on the floor of the temple, he began to nod
from sleepiness.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they did,” put in Ned. “Let’s take a
look.”</p>

<p>He unfastened one of the oil lamps from
the auto and started off on an exploring trip.
A little to the left of the corner where
the auto stood he came to a door. Though
it worked hard on the rusted hinges he managed
to push it open. He flashed the light
inside.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Here are some beds or couches or
something of the kind!” he shouted.</p>

<p>The others came hurrying up. The room
seemed to be a sort of resting place for the priests
of the ancient temple. Ranged about the side walls
were wooden frames on which were stretched skins
and hides of animals, in a manner somewhat as
the modern cot is made.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they are strong enough to hold us,”
said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Let Chunky try, he’s the heaviest,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Bob stretched out on the ancient
bed. It creaked a little, but showed no signs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
collapsing in spite of the many years it had been
in the place.</p>

<p>“This will be better than sleeping on a cold
stone floor,” remarked the professor. “Fetch
in the blankets and we’ll have a good night’s
rest.”</p>

<p>“Shall we post a guard?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it will be necessary,” replied the
naturalist. “I hardly believe there is any one in
this old city but ourselves, and we can barricade
the door to keep out any stray animals.”</p>

<p>So, in a little while, the travelers were all slumbering.
But the professor was wrong in his surmise
that they were the only inhabitants of the underground
city. No sooner had a series of snores
proclaimed that every one was sleeping than from a
dark recess on the opposite side of the temple to
that where the automobile stood there came a
strange figure, clad in white. If Bob had seen it he
surely would have said it was a ghost.</p>

<p>“So you found my ancient city after all,” whispered
the figure. “You know now that the Mexican
magician was telling the truth, and you realize
that you found the place sooner than you expected,
and in a strange manner. But there will be more
strange things happen before you go from here, I
promise you.”</p>

<p>“Are the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americano</i> dogs asleep?” sounded a
whisper from the recess whence came the aged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Mexican, who had so strangely prophesied to the
professor.</p>

<p>“Yes, San Lucia, they are asleep,” replied the
first figure, as another, attired as he was, joined
him. “But speak softly, for they have sharp ears
and wake easily.”</p>

<p>“Have they the gold with them?” asked San
Lucia, who was also quite old. “That is what we
want, Murado. Have they the gold?”</p>

<p>“All <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americanos</i> have gold,” replied Murado.
“That is why I lured them on. All my plans were
made to get them here that we might take their
gold.”</p>

<p>“And you succeeded wonderfully well, Murado.
Tell me about it, for I have not had a chance to
talk to you since you arrived in such breathless
haste.”</p>

<p>“There is not much to tell,” replied the other.
“I heard of their arrival in a short time after they
reached Mexico. Then, in a secret way, I heard
what they were searching for. Chance made it
possible for me to somewhat startle them by pretending
to know more than I did. I met them on
the road and told them of what they were in
search and how to find it.”</p>

<p>“That was easy, since you knew so well yourself,”
interrupted San Lucia. “We have not been
brigands for nothing, Murado. Well do I remember
the day you and I came upon this buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
city. And it has been our headquarters ever
since.”</p>

<p>“As I said, it was easy to mystify them,” went
on Murado. “They traveled fast in their steam
wagon, or whatever it is, but I knew several short
cuts that enabled me to get ahead of them. I was
hidden in the hollow stone image of the laughing
serpent and saw, through the little eye-holes, how
they came up and took the paper I had written and
put between the lips of the reptile. Oh, it all
worked out as I had planned, and now we have
them here where we want them.”</p>

<p>“And we will kill them and get their gold!”
whispered San Lucia, feeling of a knife he wore in
his belt. “But tell me, how did they happen to
stumble on the right underground passage?”</p>

<p>“They didn’t happen to,” replied Murado.
“That was one point where I failed. But it is
just as well. You see, I had so managed things
that I knew they would take the road to the left
of the image. When I saw them depart I called
my horse and galloped off to the right. I wanted
to take a short cut and get here ahead of them.</p>

<p>“I succeeded. You were away; just when I
needed your help, too. But I managed. I went out
in the underground passage and waited for them.</p>

<p>“That passage, you know, goes right under the
road they were traveling on. Whoever built this
ancient city must have wanted it to remain hidden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
for the only way to get to it is by the tunnels. If,
by chance, some one approached on the roads leading
to the top of the mountains the ancients had a
plan to get rid of them.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked San Lucia.</p>

<p>“At several places in the upper roadway there
were false places. That is, they were traps. A
portion of the road would be dug away, making a
shaft down to the tunnel. Then boards would be
placed over the hole and a light covering of dirt
sprinkled on the planks. Watchers were stationed
below, and at the sound of an enemy on the boards
above the sentinels would pull a lever. This would
take away the supports of the false portion of the
road, and it would crash down into the tunnel,
carrying the enemy with it.</p>

<p>“So I played the part of the watcher, and when
I heard the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americanos</i> riding over the trap I
pulled the lever and down they crashed.</p>

<p>“There, as I said, I made my only mistake. I
expected the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americanos</i> would be killed, but their
steam cart is strong, and the fall did not hurt them.
Besides, only one end of the trap gave way, and
the other, holding fast, made an inclined road on
which they descended into the tunnel. That is how
they came here, and now we must to work if we are
to get their gold.”</p>

<p>“And quickly, too,” observed San Lucia, “for
I learned that another party is following this; they,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
too, have a steam wagon, and we may trap them
also.”</p>

<p>“I know the crowd of whom you speak,” said
Murado. “They are not far behind. One is a
youth called Nixy Nodnot, or some barbarous thing
like it. They will be surprised not to find their
friends. But come, they sleep!”</p>

<p>Then the two Mexican brigands began creeping
toward the room where the professor and the boys
were sleeping.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a><br />
<small>NODDY HAS A TUMBLE.</small></h2>


<p>When Vasco and Noddy, foiled in their attempt
to kidnap Bob, retreated through the forest,
they went into camp with their crowd in no very
pleasant frame of mind. The Mexicans whom
Vasco had hired to assist him were angry at being
foiled, and they talked of deserting.</p>

<p>“Go on, if you want to,” said Vasco, carelessly
rolling a cigarette; “so much the more gold for us
when the rich man ransoms his son.”</p>

<p>This was enough to excite the greed of the men,
who talked no more of going away.</p>

<p>The next day, after a consultation, Noddy and
Vasco decided to continue on the trail of the boys
and the professor. They pursued the same tactics
they had previous to the interrupted kidnapping,
and were careful not to get too close to those they
were trailing.</p>

<p>All was not harmonious among the members of
the band with which Noddy had surrounded himself.
The men had frequent quarrels, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
when they were playing cards, which they seemed
to do when they were not smoking cigarettes.</p>

<p>After dinner one day the Mexicans appeared to
be much amused as they played their game. They
laughed and shouted and seemed to be talking of
the automobile, for Noddy had brought his machine
up to the camp of the horsemen.</p>

<p>“What are they talking about?” asked Noddy
of Vasco.</p>

<p>“They are making a wager that the one who
loses the game must ride, all by himself, in the
automobile,” replied Bilette.</p>

<p>“But I don’t want them to do that,” said Noddy.
“They don’t know how to run the car.”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” went on Vasco. “No one
wants to lose, for they’re all afraid to operate the
machine. But if one of them tries to do it, you’d
better let him, if you don’t want to get into
trouble.”</p>

<p>With a shout of laughter the men arose from
where they had been playing the game. They
seemed to be railing at one chap, who looked at
the auto as if he feared it might blow up and kill
him.</p>

<p>“You’re in for it,” remarked Vasco. “Whatever
you do don’t make a fuss.”</p>

<p>With a somewhat sheepish air a young Mexican,
one of Vasco’s crowd, came near the auto. He
made a sign that he wanted to take Noddy’s place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
The latter frowned and spoke in English, only a
word or two of which the native understood.</p>

<p>“You shan’t have this machine,” spoke Noddy.
“It’s mine, and if you try to run it you’ll break it.”</p>

<p>But the Mexican paid no heed. He came close
up to Noddy, grabbed him by the collar and hauled
him from the car. Noddy was the only one in it at
that time, Berry, Dalsett and Pender having gone
off a short distance.</p>

<p>“Let go of me!” cried Noddy, trying to draw
a small revolver he carried.</p>

<p>The Mexican only grunted and retained his grip.</p>

<p>“If you don’t let me alone I’ll fire!” exclaimed
the youth. He had his revolver out, and the Mexican,
seeing this, allowed his temper to cool a bit.
But there was an angry look in his eyes that
meant trouble for Noddy.</p>

<p>“Now you fellows quit this gambling,” commanded
Vasco. “We’ll have hard work ahead of
us in a little while, and we don’t want any foolishness.
Leave Noddy alone. Don’t you know if any
one tries to run that machine that hasn’t been introduced
to it, the engine will blow up!”</p>

<p>“<em lang="es" xml:lang="es">Diablo!</em>” exclaimed the Mexican who had lost
at cards and who was about to attempt to operate
the auto. “I will let it alone!”</p>

<p>Quiet was restored, but the bad feeling was only
smoothed over. It was liable to break out again
at any time. The main object of the crowd was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
not lost sight of, however, and every hour they
drew nearer the trail of those of whom they were
in pursuit.</p>

<p>As it grew dusk, on the day of the quarrel over
the auto, Noddy and Vasco, with their followers,
came to a small clearing. They decided to stop
and have supper.</p>

<p>“If I’m not mistaken, the other auto has been
here within a short time,” remarked Vasco, pointing
to marks in the sandy road. “And there seem
to be footprints leading over there through the underbrush.”</p>

<p>He followed the trail, and came to the place
where, a short time before, Professor Snodgrass
had battled with the cocoanut-throwing monkeys.</p>

<p>“Looks as if some one was going to start in
the wholesale business,” went on the Mexican,
glancing at the pile of nuts the simians had
piled up.</p>

<p>“Do you think we are close to them?” asked
Noddy, for, since the experience of the afternoon,
he was anxious to get the kidnapping over, and be
rid of the Mexicans.</p>

<p>“They have been here very recently,” said Vasco.</p>

<p>“How can you tell?” asked Noddy.</p>

<p>“See where the oil has dripped from their machine,”
replied Bilette, pointing to a little puddle
of the lubricant in the road. “It has not yet had
time to soak away, showing that it must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
there but a short time, since in this sand it would
not remain long on top.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go on after them or camp for the
night?” asked Noddy, following a somewhat
lengthy pause.</p>

<p>“Keep on,” replied Vasco. “No telling when
we may get another chance. Get the boy when we
can. We’ll have to do a little night traveling, but
what of it?”</p>

<p>Noddy assented. He spent some time after
supper in oiling up the auto and getting the lamps
filled, for darkness was coming on. Then, all
being in readiness, Noddy started off, the horsemen
keeping close to him.</p>

<p>For a few miles no one in the party spoke. The
auto puffed slowly along, the horsemen managing
to keep up to it.</p>

<p>“How do we know we’re on the right road?”
asked Noddy at length. “We may have gone
astray in the darkness.”</p>

<p>Tom Dalsett took a lantern and made a careful
survey of the highway. He came back presently.</p>

<p>“We’re all right,” he said. “There are auto
tracks just ahead of us. We may come up to them
any minute now.”</p>

<p>Once more Noddy’s auto, which he had stopped
to let Dalsett out, started up. The pace was swift
and silent. But as they penetrated farther and farther
into the depths of the forest there was no sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of the boys and the professor, who, by this time,
were in the underground city.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we’ll find them,” spoke Jack
Pender. “Let’s camp now and take up the trail
in the morning, when you can see better.”</p>

<p>“No; we must keep on,” said Vasco, firmly. “It
is to-night or never. I can’t hold my men together
any longer than that.”</p>

<p>Off into the darkness puffed the auto. The men
on horseback followed it, the whole party keeping
close together, for several jaguars were seen near
the path, having been driven from their usual
haunts because of the scarcity of game.</p>

<p>Every one was on the alert, watching for any
signs of the travelers they were pursuing. Every
now and then some one would get out and examine
the road to see if the auto marks were still to be
seen. They were there, and led straight on to the
hidden city.</p>

<p>It was some time past midnight and the machine
was going over a good patch of road, when Jack
Pender, who was seated beside Noddy, suddenly
grabbed the steersman’s arm.</p>

<p>“What’s that ahead in the road?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything,” replied Noddy. “It’s
your imagination. What does it look like?”</p>

<p>“Like a big black shadow, bigger and blacker
than any around here. Can’t you see it now? There
it is! Stop the machine, quick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Noddy, peering through the gloom, saw what
seemed to be a patch of shadows. He gave the
levers quick yanks, jammed down the brakes and
tried to bring the machine to a stop.</p>

<p>But he was too late. With a plunge the car sank
through the earth and rushed along the inclined
plane down which Jerry and his friends had coasted
a few hours before. There were wild cries of fear,
mingled with the shrill neighing of horses, for
some of the riders and their steeds also went down
the trap that had been laid.</p>

<p>The auto remained upright and shot along the
floor of the tunnel to which it had fallen, undergoing
the same experience as had the machine of
Jerry and his friends.</p>

<p>Then, with a crash that resounded through the
confines of the ancient city, Noddy and his machine
and all who were in it brought up against the massive
door closing the tunnel, which portal Jerry
had swung shut after he and his friends had passed
through. Following the crash there came an
ominous silence.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a><br />
<small>FACE TO FACE.</small></h2>


<p>“Hark! What was that?” whispered San
Lucia to Murado.</p>

<p>The two old brigands paused in their stealthy
march upon their sleeping victims, as the sound of
the crash Noddy’s auto made came faintly to their
ears.</p>

<p>“How should I know?” asked Murado, but he
seemed alarmed.</p>

<p>“It sounded in the tunnel,” went on San Lucia.
“Some one is coming! Quick! Let us hide! Another
night will do for our work.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the two old villains, alarmed by the
terror of the noise caused by they knew not what,
hesitated and then fled as silently as they had advanced.
For the time the lives of the boys and the
professor had been saved.</p>

<p>San Lucia and Murado went to their hiding
place in the old temple, the building being so large
and rambling that it would have hidden a score of
men with ease. It may be added here that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
did not dare to touch many things in the ancient
city, thinking them bewitched.</p>

<p>All unmindful of the danger which had menaced
them, our travelers slept on, nothing disturbing
them, and they did not hear the noise made by
Noddy’s tumble, though they were not far from
the mouth of the tunnel.</p>

<p>“I say!” called Bob, sitting up and looking at his
watch in a sunbeam that came through a broken
window. “I say, are you fellows going to sleep all
day? It’s nearly eight o’clock, and I want some
breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course it’s something to eat as soon as
you open your eyes!” exclaimed Jerry. “I should
think you would take something to bed with you,
Chunky, and put it under your pillow so you could
eat in the night whenever you felt hungry.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” snapped Bob, “but I notice
we don’t have to call you twice to come to your
meals.”</p>

<p>“Is it morning?” called the professor from his
cot.</p>

<p>“Long ago,” replied Bob, who was dressing. “I
wonder if the folks that lived in this temple ever
washed. I’d like to strike a bathroom about now.”</p>

<p>“Hark! I hear something!” exclaimed the professor.</p>

<p>They all listened intently.</p>

<p>“It’s running water,” said the naturalist, “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
close by. Perhaps there’s a wash-room in this
temple.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to see what’s behind this door,” said
Bob, pointing to a portal none of them had noticed
in the darkness. He pushed it open and went inside.
The next instant he uttered a joyful cry:</p>

<p>“Come here, fellows! It’s a plunge bath!”</p>

<p>Then they heard him spring in and splash about.
Jerry and Ned soon followed, and the professor
came a little later. It was a regular swimming-tank,
stone-lined and sunk into the floor. The
water came in through a sort of stone trough.</p>

<p>“These old chaps knew something about life,
after all,” observed Ned, as he climbed out and
proceeded to dry himself.</p>

<p>“They were probably a bit like the Romans,”
remarked the professor, “and fond of bathing.
But something has given me an appetite, and I
wouldn’t object to breakfast.”</p>

<p>The others were of the same mind, and soon
Ned had the gasolene stove set up and was preparing
a meal. Bob attended to the brewing of the
coffee instead of chocolate, and the aroma of the
beverage filled the old temple with an appetizing
odor.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do to-day?” asked Jerry,
when they had finished the meal and were sitting
comfortably on some low stools that had been discovered
in the room where they slept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“We must explore the city in all directions,” said
the professor. “There are many marvelous things
here, and I have not begun to find them yet. It
will take weeks and weeks.”</p>

<p>“Are we going to stay here all that while?”
asked Bob, somewhat dubiously.</p>

<p>“I’d like to,” answered the naturalist. “But we
can get a good load of specimens and relics, run up
north and come back for more. This place is a
regular treasure-trove.”</p>

<p>Clearing away the remains of the breakfast, and
looking over the auto to see that it had suffered
no damage in the recent experience, the boys and
the professor left the temple and strolled out into
the deserted city. They did not know that their
every movement was watched by the glittering eyes
of San Lucia and Murado, who were hidden in an
upper part of the temple whence they could look
down on their intended victims from a small, concealed
gallery.</p>

<p>By full daylight the ancient city was even more
wonderful than it had appeared in the waning
light of the previous afternoon. In the days of its
glory it was evident it had been a beautiful place.</p>

<p>The travelers entered some of the better-preserved
houses. They found the rooms filled with
fine furniture, of a rude but simple and pleasing
character, some of the articles being well preserved.</p>

<p>One house they visited seemed to have belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to some rich man, for it was filled with things that
once had been of great beauty.</p>

<p>“There is something that should interest me!”
exclaimed the professor, as he caught sight of a
small cabinet on the wall. “That must contain
curios.”</p>

<p>He found his supposition right, and fairly reveled
in the objects that were treasures to him, but
not worth much to any one else. There were ancient
coins, rings and other articles of jewelry and
hundreds of bugs, beetles and minerals.</p>

<p>“Whoever lived here was a wise and learned
man,” observed the naturalist. “I shall take his
whole collection back with me, since it is going to
ruin here, and it belongs to no one.”</p>

<p>“There will be no room for any of us in the auto
if you keep on collecting things,” observed Jerry.</p>

<p>But this seemed to make no difference to the professor.
He went right on collecting as if he had a
freight car at his disposal.</p>

<p>The travelers continued on their way, exploring
the different buildings here and there.</p>

<p>“I’m tired,” announced Bob, suddenly. “You
fellows can go on, if you want to, but I’m going to
sit down and take a rest.”</p>

<p>He found a comfortable place in the shade,
where a stone ledge was built against the side of a
ruined house, and sat down. Jerry and Ned followed
his example, for they, too, were leg-weary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll just take a look through this one place, and
then we’ll go back and have dinner,” said the professor.</p>

<p>He entered the structure, against which the boys
were sitting. It was a small, one-storied affair, and
did not look as if it would contain anything of
value. The naturalist had not been inside five
minutes before the boys heard him calling, in excited
tones:</p>

<p>“Come quick, boys!”</p>

<p>They ran in, to behold Professor Snodgrass with
his arm stuck in a hole in the wall. He seemed to
be pulling at something.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“A gila monster,” replied the professor. “I
saw him and I got him.”</p>

<p>“It looks as if he had you,” answered Ned.</p>

<p>“He tried to get away, but I grabbed him by the
tail as he was going in his hole,” went on the naturalist.
“Now he’s got his claws dug down in the
dirt and I can’t pull him out. Come out of there,
my beauty!” he cried, addressing his remarks
to the hidden gila monster. “Come out, my
pet!”</p>

<p>Then, with a sudden yank the professor succeeded
in drawing the animal from its burrow. It
was a repulsive-looking creature of the lizard variety,
and as the professor held it up by the tail it
wiggled and tried to escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now I have you, my little darling!” the naturalist
cried, popping his prize into his collecting-box.</p>

<p>“That would never take a prize at a beauty
show,” observed Ned. “I wouldn’t touch it with
a ten-foot pole.”</p>

<p>“Well, this has been a most profitable day,”
went on the collector, as, with the boys, he turned
toward their residence in the old temple. “I must
come back this afternoon for the cabinet of
curios.”</p>

<p>Without further incident, save that nearly every
step of the homeward journey the professor stopped
to pick up some relic, the travelers reached the
temple.</p>

<p>“Here goes for another bath!” cried Bob, running
toward the room where the plunge was. “I’m
nearly melted by the heat.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you!” said Jerry.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard the professor’s voice calling
them.</p>

<p>“I wonder what in the world is the matter
now?” said Jerry.</p>

<p>He and Bob hurried outside where they had
left the naturalist and Ned. They found the
pair gazing down the street toward the tunnel
entrance.</p>

<p>And as they gazed they saw the big door swing
slowly open, while from the passage came Noddy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Nixon, Vasco Bilette and the others of their crowd.
A low cry of surprise broke from Noddy as he
stood face to face with the very persons he and
Vasco were seeking.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a><br />
<small>BOB IS KIDNAPPED.</small></h2>


<p>For a minute or two the unexpected encounter so
astonished all concerned that no one spoke. Noddy
seemed ill at ease from meeting his former acquaintances,
but Vasco Bilette smiled in an evil
way. Chance had thrown in his path the very person
he wanted. Tom Dalsett was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Well, we meet again,” he said, with an attempt
at cheerfulness. “How do you all do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that we’re any the better for seeing
you,” remarked Professor Snodgrass, who was
plain-spoken at times.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I assure you it’s a sight for sore eyes
to get a glimpse of you once more,” went on Tom.
“Besides, this is a free city, you know, even if it is
an old, underground one; and we have as much
right here as you have.”</p>

<p>“True enough,” broke in Jerry. “But you may
as well know, first as last, that we’re done fooling
with you and your gang, Noddy Nixon. If you
annoy us again there’s going to be trouble!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Noddy did not reply. He seemed anxious to
get away, but Dalsett and Vasco urged him to stay,
and they had secured quite an influence over the
youth.</p>

<p>“We must have come in by the same passage you
did,” went on Dalsett. “You left it open behind
you. We were wandering around in the dark tunnel
until we discovered this door a little while ago.
Lucky, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“For you chaps, yes,” commented Ned.</p>

<p>“Some of us were nearly killed in the tumble,”
went on Dalsett. “We got out of it rather well, on
the whole.”</p>

<p>“You’d better come inside and have nothing
more to say to him,” said the professor to his
friends. “This spoils all our plans.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; perhaps we can give them the slip
among the ruins,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>He went back into the ancient temple, and the
others followed him. Noddy continued to stare
as if he thought the whole thing was a dream. As
for Vasco and Dalsett, they were much pleased with
the turn affairs had taken.</p>

<p>But the Mexicans were excited. Several of them
had been bruised by the fall into the tunnel, and
they wanted to proceed at once and kidnap Bob, so
they could get the ransom money. But Vasco would
not permit this. He did not believe in using force
when he could use stealth. Besides, he was a coward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and afraid of getting hurt, if it came to a
fight.</p>

<p>“Let them go,” he said to his men, who murmured
as they saw their prospective captive and his
friends retreat into the temple. “Let them go.
They can’t get away from here without letting us
know. We are better off than before. We can capture
the fat boy whenever we want to now.”</p>

<p>With that, Vasco’s followers had to be content.
As Dalsett had said, Noddy and his cronies, after
groping about in the dark tunnel for some time,
had finally discovered the door by which the boys
and the professor had entered the ancient city.
They had pushed it open and come face to face
with our friends.</p>

<p>“Bah!” exclaimed one of the Mexicans. “It is
always to-morrow and to-morrow in this business.
Let us fight them! Let us get the captive and let
us share the ransom.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do the trick to-night, sure,” promised
Vasco. “To-night, positively, we will kidnap Bob.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all unconscious of the fate in store
for him, Bob was making a substantial meal, for
the travelers had begun to get dinner after withdrawing
from the front of the temple. They talked
of little save the appearance of Noddy and his
followers.</p>

<p>“How do you suppose he ever got here?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“Simply followed us,” said Jerry. “We left a
plain enough trail. Besides, automobiles are scarce
in Mexico, and any one seeing ours pass by would
easily remember it and tell whoever came along
afterward, making inquiries.”</p>

<p>“What had we better do?” asked Ned. “Stay
here or go away?”</p>

<p>“There’ll be more or less trouble if we stay,” was
Jerry’s opinion. “Supposing we go away for a
while and come back. If Noddy is after us we
may give him the slip and return.”</p>

<p>“How are we going to get out of this place?”
asked Bob. “We can’t go back through the tunnel
we came in, as they are now on guard there.”</p>

<p>“There must be more than one entrance to this
city,” spoke the professor. “I think I’ll go and
hunt for another. When we find it we can take the
automobile with us and escape to-night. I wish to
be the first person to announce this discovery to
the world.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea!” exclaimed Ned. “I’ll go
along to help hunt for another passage, while Bob
and Jerry can stay on guard.”</p>

<p>“In the meanwhile I’m going to have my swim,”
said Bob. He went into the tank-room, and immediately
uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” called Jerry.</p>

<p>“The water has all run out,” replied Bob, “and
there’s a big hole here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The others came in on the run. They saw that
the swimming-pool was empty. Only a little water
remained on the bottom in small puddles. They also
saw that the pool was made with an incline of stone
leading from the floor level down to the bottom.
In the side opposite from where the incline was a
big black hole showed itself. When the water was
at the normal level this hole was invisible. Once
the water had lowered it was plain to see.</p>

<p>“What made the water go out?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Probably a gate at the end of the tunnel leading
from the tank was opened,” replied the naturalist.
“Or it may be an automatic arrangement,
so that when the tank gets filled up to a certain
height the water shuts itself off. So we’ll defer our
bath until the water rises. Perhaps the tides may
have some effect on it. We can only wait and see.”</p>

<p>“That tunnel is big enough to drive our auto
through,” observed Bob.</p>

<p>A sudden thought came to Jerry. He whispered
to the professor.</p>

<p>“Of course it could be done,” replied the scientist
after consideration, “but there is the danger
of the water rising suddenly while we are in the
tunnel. Jerry talks of escaping by means of this
new shaft,” went on the professor. “We could
run the auto down the incline and so out. But
we must investigate the place.”</p>

<p>The naturalist walked down the incline. Straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
in front of them, as they neared it, yawned the
black mouth of the passage. The professor would
not let the boys come in until he had made an investigation.</p>

<p>He walked quite a distance down the shaft and
returned. He seemed in deep thought.</p>

<p>“It will be safe to use the tunnel,” he said. “It
appears that the water was siphoned out. There
is another tank or reservoir connected with this
one. They both seem to be fed by springs. When
the other tank, which is below the level and to one
side, gets full of water, the fluid is siphoned out.
As that tank is connected with the one we used, by
a pipe, as soon as the water goes out of the first
tank, that in the second follows to keep the first
tank filled. And so it goes on, from day to day,
repeating the operation once every twenty-four
hours, I would judge. So we have plenty of time.
The tunnel leads to one like that by which we entered
the city. I have no doubt but that we can
escape through it.”</p>

<p>If the professor and the boys could at this time
have seen two evil faces peering down at them from
a high balcony, they might not have felt so comfortable.
San Lucia and Murado were on the lookout,
and every move the travelers made was
watched.</p>

<p>It was decided to make the escape that night.
Accordingly, after supper, the automobile was prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
for a long trip. Things were packed in it,
and the professor took along his beloved specimens.</p>

<p>“How are we going to get the car down the incline?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I can take it down, all right,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>At length all was in readiness. Jerry and Ned
took the front seat, Bob cranked up the car, which
was still inside the old temple, and then joined the
professor on the rear seat.</p>

<p>“All ready?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“All ready,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we are ready, too!” came in a whisper
from the ruined doorway of the temple, where
Vasco Bilette and his men were in hiding, watching
the flight of the travelers.</p>

<p>The Mexican had guessed some sort of an attempt
to escape would be made, and was on hand
to frustrate it. But the preparations made for
taking the auto down into the empty water pool
puzzled Vasco. So he was on the alert.</p>

<p>“Here we go!” called Jerry, softly. The auto
was vibrating, but almost noiselessly, for the explosions
of the motor could scarcely be heard.</p>

<p>Down the incline Jerry took the heavy car, without
a mishap. Straight for the open mouth of the
tunnel he steered it. It was as dark as pitch now,
but the lamps on the car gave good illumination.</p>

<p>“Come on, we have them now!” cried Vasco to
his followers. “The boy is in the back seat!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mexicans ran down the incline. By this
time the machine was well into the mouth of the
shaft. Hearing footsteps behind him, resounding
on the stone pavement, Jerry shut off the power
for a moment. As he did so the car was surrounded
by ugly-looking brigands, who had run up at a
signal from Vasco.</p>

<p>“Quick! Grab him!” cried Dalsett.</p>

<p>“I have him!” replied Vasco.</p>

<p>He reached up, and, though Bob was a heavy
lad, the Mexican, with the help of Dalsett, pulled
him over the rear seat. Bob fought, kicked and
struggled. It was of no avail. Then a sack was
quickly thrown over his head, and the men ran
back out of the tunnel and up the incline, bearing
Chunky with them.</p>

<p>“Bob’s been kidnapped!” shouted the professor.
“Turn the auto around, Jerry, and chase after
them!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a><br />
<small>BOB TRIES TO FLEE.</small></h2>


<p>In an instant Jerry tried to turn the auto around.
He found the passage too narrow. There was
nothing to do but to back up the incline. This was
a slow process in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Fire at them!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“No. You might hit Bob!” said the professor.
“We must chase after the brigands. This is what
they have been following us for. I wonder what
they want of Bob?”</p>

<p>No one could guess. By this time Jerry had run
the machine up the inclined plane and into the
temple. Then he sent it out into the street. It
was as dark as a pocket and not a trace of the kidnappers
could be seen, nor could they be heard.
The capture of Bob came as a terrible blow.</p>

<p>“Let’s take to the tunnel where we came in!”
cried Ned. “Perhaps they are hiding there.”</p>

<p>“If they are, they are well armed, and their
force is three times what ours is now,” said the
professor. “If we are to help Bob we will have to
do it by strategy rather than by force. Come, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
had better go back to the temple. We can make
our plans from there.”</p>

<p>“Poor Chunky!” groaned Jerry. “I wonder
what they are doing to him now?”</p>

<p>“I guess it was his money-belt they wanted more
than they did him,” put in Ned. “You know he
carried what was left of the five hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” exclaimed Jerry, with a rueful face.</p>

<p>“Never mind the money; I have plenty,” put in
the naturalist. “And don’t worry; we’ll find Bob
yet.”</p>

<p>Nothing could be done that night, so the professor
and the two boys tried to get what sleep
their troubled minds would allow. In the morning
they made a hurried breakfast and then held a consultation.
It was decided to explore the tunnel by
which they had entered the city, and see if it still
held the brigands and Noddy’s crowd.</p>

<p>Arming themselves, the professor, Ned and
Jerry advanced carefully through the big wooden
gate. They proceeded cautiously, but no one opposed
them. The tunnel was deserted. They came
to the hole where they had tumbled down. The
inclined plane of planks was there, in the same position
as when the cave-in, produced by Murado,
had occurred.</p>

<p>“They have probably gone back up here and are
running across country,” remarked Ned. “Hello!”
he exclaimed. “What’s that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>He picked up a small object that lay at the foot
of the incline, in the glare of the sunlight that
streamed in from above.</p>

<p>“That’s Bob’s knife,” said Jerry. “He had it
yesterday. That shows he must have been here
since. There is no doubt but that they have carried
him away from here.”</p>

<p>The professor agreed that this was probably the
case. There was nothing left to do, so they returned
to the temple.</p>

<p>“I hardly know what to do,” said the naturalist.
“We might take the automobile and ride off, not
knowing where, in a vain endeavor to find Bob.
Or we can stay here on the chance that he may escape
and come back. If we went away he would
not know where to find us.</p>

<p>“Then, too, I am hopeful we may hear something
from Noddy Nixon or some of those Mexicans
he had with him. Those fellows are regular
brigands, and may have captured Bob, thinking we
will pay a ransom for his return. On the whole, I
think we had better stay here for a few days.”</p>

<p>This seemed the best thing to do. With heavy
hearts, Jerry and Ned wandered about the old temple,
wishing their chum was back with them. The
professor began to gather more specimens and
made several trips to the old buildings where he
got many curios of value.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, poor Bob was having his own troubles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
At the first rough attack of the kidnappers,
when he was hauled over the back of the auto, he
did not know what had happened. He supposed
it was some accident, such as the tunnel caving in
or the water suddenly rising.</p>

<p>But when he found himself held by two men, and
the bag thrown over his head, he realized that he
was a captive, though he did not know why any one
would want him.</p>

<p>Holding him between them, Vasco and Dalsett
ran back into the bath and up the incline, followed
by Noddy and the Mexicans. Berry and Pender
had been left in charge of the auto and horses,
which were in the first tunnel.</p>

<p>Bob, who had not attempted to struggle after
his first involuntary kicking when he was hauled
out, decided that his captors were having too
easy a time of it. He was by no means
a baby, and though he was fat he had considerable
muscle.</p>

<p>So he began to beat about with his fists, and to
kick with his heavy shoes, in a manner that made
it very uncomfortable for Vasco and Dalsett.</p>

<p>“Quit that, you young cub, or I’ll hurt you!” exclaimed
Vasco.</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ I’ll do the same!” growled Dalsett,
and, recognizing the voice, Bob knew for the first
time into whose hands he had fallen.</p>

<p>He did not heed the command to stop struggling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and it was all the two men could do to hold him.
Suddenly they laid him down.</p>

<p>“Look here!” exclaimed Dalsett, sitting on Bob
to keep him still, “if you want us to tie you up like
a steer we’re willin’ to do it. An’ we’ll gag you into
the bargain. If you quit wigglin’ you’ll be treated
decent.”</p>

<p>“Then you take this bag off my head!” demanded
Bob, with some spirit.</p>

<p>“I will if you promise to walk an’ not make us
carry you,” promised Dalsett.</p>

<p>“I’ll walk until I get a good chance to get away,”
replied Bob, determined to give no parole.</p>

<p>“Mighty little chance you have of gittin’ away,”
remarked Dalsett, as he removed the sack.</p>

<p>It was as dark as a pocket, and Bob wondered
where he was. Soon one of the men came with a
lantern, and by the gleam the captive could see he
was in the tunnel.</p>

<p>“Come on!” ordered Vasco.</p>

<p>Walking in the midst of his captors, Bob came
to the foot of the incline. There he found Noddy,
Pender and Bill Berry in the auto. The Mexicans
had their horses in readiness for a flight.</p>

<p>“They’re going to take me away,” thought Bob.
“I wonder how I can give the boys and the professor
a sign so they will know that?”</p>

<p>His fingers came in contact with his knife and
that gave him an idea. He dropped the implement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
on the ground, where it was found by his friends
later.</p>

<p>“Is everything ready?” asked Vasco.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” replied Noddy. “Shall I run the
machine up the incline?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Dalsett. “We’ll walk with
our young friend here. I reckon the car will have
trouble gittin’ up the hill if too many gits
in it.”</p>

<p>“Come on, you fellows!” ordered Vasco of his
Mexicans. “We have the captive now, and you’ll
soon be dividing the ransom money.” He spoke
in Spanish, which Bob could not understand. The
boy was at a loss why so many should be interested
in him, but laid it all to a plot of Noddy’s to get
square.</p>

<p>It was quite a pull for the auto, up the steep incline,
but Noddy, by using the low gear,
managed it. The horses and their riders
had less trouble, and soon the whole party
stood in the road near the tunnel that led to
the underground city.</p>

<p>Bob was placed on a small pony, and his hands
were tied behind his back. Then, with a Mexican
riding before and after him, and one on each side,
the cavalcade started off.</p>

<p>For several hours the journey was kept up. No
one said much, and poor Bob puzzled his brains
trying to think what it all meant. One thing he determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
on: that he would try to escape at the
first opportunity.</p>

<p>It came sooner than he expected. He had been
working at the bonds on his hands and found, to
his joy, that the rope was coming loose. In their
hurry, Vasco and Dalsett had not tied it very securely.
In a little while Bob had freed his wrists,
but he kept his hands behind his back, to let his
captors think he was still bound.</p>

<p>He waited until he came to a level stretch of
land. Then, at a time when the Mexican in the
rear had ridden off to one side to borrow a cigarette
of a comrade, Bob slipped from the pony’s
back.</p>

<p>He struck the ground rather hard, but here his
fat served him in good stead, for he was not hurt
much. Then he rolled quickly out of the way of
the horses’ feet.</p>

<p>Jumping up, he ran at top speed off to the
left. Instantly the cavalcade was in confusion.
Vasco and Dalsett came riding back to see
what the trouble was. They saw Bob bounding
away.</p>

<p>“After him!” shouted Vasco, drawing his revolver
and firing in the air to scare Bob. “After
him! He’s worth ten thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>The Mexicans spurred their horses after the
fugitive, while Noddy, turning the auto around,
lighted the search-lamp and sent the light through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the blackness to pick out Bob so the others could
find him in the darkness.</p>

<p>On and on ran the boy, and after him thundered
the horses of his pursuers, coming nearer and
nearer.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a><br />
<small>AN UNEXPECTED FRIEND.</small></h2>


<p>It was too uneven a chase to last long. Bob soon
found that his enemies were gaining on him, and
he resolved to play a trick. He came to a big rock
and dropped down behind it, hiding in the shadow.</p>

<p>For a time the Mexicans were baffled, but they
spread about in a half circle and Bob could hear
them gradually surrounding him. Still he hoped
to escape detection.</p>

<p>“Can’t you find him?” he heard Noddy call.</p>

<p>“He seems to have given us the slip,” replied
Vasco. “But we’ll get him yet.”</p>

<p>Noddy sent the searchlight of the automobile all
about the rock behind which Bob was hidden, but
the deep shadow cast protected the boy.</p>

<p>At length, however, one of the Mexicans approached
the place. At the same instant Bob was
seized with an uncontrollable desire to sneeze. His
nose tickled and, though he held his breath and did
everything he had ever read about calculated to
prevent sneezes, the tickling increased. Finally
he gave voice to a loud “Ka-choo!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em lang="es" xml:lang="es">Diablo!</em>” exclaimed the nearest Mexican.
“What have we here?”</p>

<p>He was at the rock in an instant and lost no time
in grabbing Bob. The boy tried to struggle and
escape again, but his captor held him in a firm grip.
The Mexican set up a shout at the discovery of his
prize, which speedily brought Vasco and his comrades
to the scene.</p>

<p>“So, you didn’t care much for our company,”
observed Bilette. “But never mind, we think so
much of you that we run after you wherever you
go. Now we have you again!” and he laughed in
an unpleasant manner.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what you want of me,” remarked
Bob, as he was led back and placed
on his pony.</p>

<p>“Ah, perhaps you are not aware that you are
worth much money to us,” said Vasco.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you all I have if you’ll let me go,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>“That is something we overlooked,” said Dalsett.
“Take his money, Vasco. He may have a
few dollars.”</p>

<p>In another minute Bob’s money-belt, with the
best part of five hundred dollars, was in the possession
of the Mexicans. He wished he had kept
still.</p>

<p>“This is doing very well,” observed Vasco, as he
counted over the bills with glistening eyes. “This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
is very well indeed, and most unexpected. But we
want more than this.”</p>

<p>“It is all I have,” answered Bob.</p>

<p>“But your people, your father has more,” went
on the Mexican. “I think if you were to write him
a letter, stating that you were about to be killed
unless he sent ten thousand dollars, he would be
glad to give us the small amount.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never write such a letter!” exclaimed Bob.
“You can kill me if you want to!”</p>

<p>“You’ll think differently in the morning,” remarked
Vasco. “Here, you fellows, tie him up
so he can’t get away again!”</p>

<p>This time the ropes were knotted so tightly about
the boy’s arms and legs that he knew he could not
work them loose. He was thrown over the back of
the pony and the cavalcade started off again.</p>

<p>All night long the march continued, the men on
their horses and Noddy and his friends in the auto.
Poor Bob felt sick at heart over his failure to escape
and the knowledge, conveyed to him in
Vasco’s remarks, that he was being held for ransom.</p>

<p>Just as day was beginning to break, the party
reached a small Mexican village and preparations
were made to spend some time there. Vasco and his
men seemed to know the place well, for they were
greeted by many of the inhabitants of the place who
had arisen early. Noddy ran the automobile under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
a shed and then the whole crowd, taking Bob with
them, went to a large house at the end of the principal
street, where they evidently intended to make
their headquarters.</p>

<p>Bob was taken to a small room on the second
floor, facing the courtyard, which is a feature of
all Mexican homes. His bonds were released and
he was thrust roughly inside.</p>

<p>The apartment was bare enough. There were a
table, a chair and a bed in the room. The
only window was guarded by heavy iron bars,
and the single door was fastened with a massive
lock.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll have trouble getting out of here,”
said Bob to himself. “It’s a regular prison. I
wonder if they’re going to starve me?”</p>

<p>He began to suffer for want of water, and his
stomach cried for food. He had some thought of
pounding on the walls and demanding to be fed,
when the door opened and a girl quickly entered,
setting on the table a tray of food. She was gone
before Bob had a chance to get a good look at her,
but he saw that she was young and pretty, attired
as she was in gay Mexican colors.</p>

<p>Though the meal was not very appetizing, it
tasted to Bob as if it was the best dinner ever
served. He felt better after eating it, and more
hopeful.</p>

<p>For several days he was held a captive in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
room. One evening Vasco Bilette and Tom Dalsett
paid him a visit.</p>

<p>“We have brought a paper for you to sign,” said
Vasco.</p>

<p>“I will sign nothing,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>“I think you will, my boy,” spoke the Mexican.
“Bring in the charcoal, Tom.”</p>

<p>Dalsett went out and returned with a small,
portable clay stove in which burned some charcoal.
Heating in the flames was an iron used for branding
cattle.</p>

<p>“You can take your choice of signing this or of
seeing how you look with a hot iron on,” said
Vasco. “This paper is a letter to your father,
telling him you have been captured by brigands,
who will not let you go excepting they are paid ten
thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never sign!” replied Bob, firmly.</p>

<p>“Then brand him!” cried Vasco.</p>

<p>One of the Mexicans took the iron from the fire.
It glowed with a white, cruel heat. At the sight
of it Bob’s courage melted away. At the same time
a plan came into his head.</p>

<p>“I’ll sign!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I thought you would,” observed Vasco. “Put
your name here.”</p>

<p>He handed Bob a letter, written to Mr. Baker,
whose name and address Noddy Nixon had supplied.
In brief, it demanded that ten thousand dollars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
be sent to the brigands and left in a lonely spot
mentioned, if Mr. Baker did not want to hear of
the death of his son. Any attempt to capture the
writers, the missive stated, would be met with the
instant killing of the boy.</p>

<p>“Sign there,” said Vasco, indicating the place.</p>

<p>Bob did so. At the same time he placed beneath
his signature a scrawl and a row of figures.</p>

<p>To the Mexicans figures meant nothing, and it is
doubtful if they observed them. But to Mr. Baker
they spelled out the message: “Send no money. I
can get away.”</p>

<p>They were figures in a secret cypher bank code
that Mr. Baker sometimes used, and which Bob
had learned.</p>

<p>“I guess that will fool them,” thought the boy,
as he saw his captors take away the letter.</p>

<p>For the next few days nothing occurred. Bob
was kept a close prisoner in his room, and the only
person he saw was the girl who brought him food.
He tried to talk to her, but she did not seem to understand
English.</p>

<p>The captive was beginning to despair. He feared
he would never see his friends again, for he did not
believe his father would send the money, and without
it he was sure the desperate men would kill him.</p>

<p>His confidence in his ability to escape lessened
as the days went by. He tried to pick the lock on
his door, and loosen a bar at the window, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
without success. It was the fifth day of his
captivity and the Mexican girl came to bring
him his supper.</p>

<p>To Bob’s surprise, this time she did not hurry
away. She set the tray of food down and looked
at him anxiously.</p>

<p>“You want go?” she asked, in a broken
accent.</p>

<p>“You mean escape? Get away from here?
Leave?” asked Bob, taking sudden hope.</p>

<p>“Um! Go ’way. Leave bad mans! Maximina
help! You go?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied Bob. “But how are you
going to manage it?”</p>

<p>“Wait till dark. Me come. You go, we go.
Leave bad mans. Me no like it here. Bad mans
whip Maximina.”</p>

<p>By which Bob understood that the girl would
come when it got dark and help him to escape, accompanying
him because she herself had been ill
treated by the Mexicans.</p>

<p>“Be good boy! Me come. You glad!” she said,
in a whisper.</p>

<p>Just then the sound of voices was heard outside
the room, in the corridor.</p>

<p>“Hush! No tell!” cautioned the girl as she
glided from the room.</p>

<p>Bob began to eat his supper. His heart was in
a flutter of hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Queer why that money don’t come,” he heard
Vasco say, outside. “We’ll have to do something
pretty soon.”</p>

<p>It was getting dark now, and Bob waited anxiously.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a><br />
<small>THE ESCAPE OF MAXIMINA.</small></h2>


<p>Several hours passed. Bob was beginning to
think Maximina had forgotten her promise, when
he heard a soft footstep outside. Then came a
gentle tapping at his door. It was unlocked from
the outside, opened, and the Mexican girl stepped
in.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she whispered. “We go now. All
bad mans gone to feast&mdash;holiday. We go. Put
on cloak.”</p>

<p>She gave Bob a long, dark serape, and produced
one for herself. Little time was lost. Led by
Maximina, Bob passed out into the dark corridor,
down the stairs and through the courtyard, out of
the house, under the silent stars that twinkled in
the sky.</p>

<p>“This way!” whispered the girl. “We ride
ponies. No one here, we take horses. Where you
live?”</p>

<p>Bob was at a loss what to do. He wondered
how he could make Maximina, whose language he
could not speak, and who could talk but imperfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
in his, understand about the underground city.
Equally hard would it be to make her comprehend
where he lived and how to start for the nearest
large city in order to get help or communicate with
his friends.</p>

<p>He remembered that his captors had brought
him almost directly north as they sped away from
the buried city. So he thought the best thing to do
would be to ride to the south, when he might see
some landmark that would aid him in locating himself.</p>

<p>“We’ll go this way,” he said, pointing in a direction
opposite to that of the north star, which
he saw blazing in the sky.</p>

<p>“All right,” exclaimed the Mexican girl. She
leaped to the back of one of two ponies she had
brought from the stable. Bob was not so expert,
but managed to get into the saddle.</p>

<p>So far they had met no one, nor had they heard
the sound of any of the Mexicans. As Maximina
had said, all of the men were away to a feast, one
of the numerous ones celebrated in the country.
Even Noddy and his friends had gone, so there was
no one left to guard Bob but the girl.</p>

<p>Away they rode, urging their ponies to a gallop.
Bob was fearful that at every turn of the road he
would meet with some of Vasco’s men, but the highway
appeared to be deserted.</p>

<p>“Me glad to go. Bad mans steal Maximina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
years ago,” said the girl, after half an hour’s ride.
“Me want to get back to own people.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could help you,” said Bob, “but I’m
about as badly off as you are. The Mexicans stole
me, too.”</p>

<p>“We both same, like orphans,” said Maximina.
“Never min’. Maybe we find our folks.”</p>

<p>By degrees she brokenly told Bob her story, how
she had been kidnapped by Vasco when she was a
child, and how he had kept her because her father
was too poor to pay the ransom demanded. She
had gradually come to be regarded as a regular
inmate of the Mexican camp, which, it seemed, was
an organized headquarters for kidnappers and
brigands generally.</p>

<p>She had never thought of escaping before, she
said, but when she saw Bob she felt sorry for him
and resolved to free not only him, but herself.</p>

<p>“We ride faster,” she said, after several miles
had been covered. “Gettin’ late. Men come back
from feast find us gone, they ride after.”</p>

<p>She urged her pony to a gallop and Bob’s animal
followed its leader.</p>

<p>“If I only had a revolver or a gun I’d shoot
some of them if they tried to take us back,” Bob
said to himself. “I hope we can get away.”</p>

<p>In a small village, about ten miles from the
camp of the Mexicans, Vasco and his friends were
having a great time. There were wild music and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
dancing, and plenty of food well seasoned with red
pepper. The Mexicans were having what they
called fun.</p>

<p>Noddy, with Jack and Bill Berry, looked on,
taking no part in the revels. They had come over
in the automobile, while Vasco and his gang rode
their horses.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when the leader of the
Mexicans decided that it was time to start for
home.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said. “Who knows but what
our prisoner has escaped.”</p>

<p>“Not much danger of that,” said Dalsett. “I
told Maximina that if he got away we’d hold her
responsible and give her a good lashing. She’ll not
let him get away.”</p>

<p>But neither Dalsett nor Vasco knew what they
were talking about. The Mexicans were reluctant
to leave the dance, but Vasco insisted. Soon the
whole party was riding back to camp, Noddy being
in advance in his auto.</p>

<p>He was the first to reach the kidnappers’ headquarters.
Dalsett was with him.</p>

<p>“I wonder how our captive is?” said the latter.</p>

<p>He went up to the room where Bob had been
locked up. To his surprise and anger, the apartment
was empty.</p>

<p>“Maximina!” he called.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’ve gone!” he exclaimed. “Here, Noddy,
ride back and meet Vasco. Tell him Bob has got
away!”</p>

<p>The automobile was sent flying down the road.
Vasco Bilette and his party were met and the news
quickly imparted.</p>

<p>“We’ll catch ’em!” cried the Mexican. “They
have only a few hours’ start, and only two slow
ponies to ride on. Here, I’ll go in the auto with
Noddy. You fellows come after me!”</p>

<p>Vasco took Jack Pender’s place in the machine
and soon the chase was on. Vasco rightly concluded
that Bob and Maximina would head for the
south, so he, too, took the road leading in that
direction.</p>

<p>Noddy speeded up the car, under Vasco’s
directions. Faster and faster it raced, the
searchlight throwing out a glaring beam far
in advance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bob and Maximina were making all
speed possible. Every now and then the girl would
halt her pony and listen intently.</p>

<p>“They no come yet,” she would say. “No
can hear horses comin’ after us. We get ’way
maybe.”</p>

<p>Bob certainly hoped so. His experience as a
captive was not such as to cause him to like the
rôle, and he longed to be with his friends, who, he
knew, must be greatly alarmed about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed to be getting darker as the two traveled
on.</p>

<p>“Be sunrise ’bout hour,” said Maximina, and
Bob remembered that he had read about it being
darkest just before daybreak. “We mus’ hide
then,” the girl went on.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sound came to them from over the
dark fields that bordered the road. At the same
time there was a shaft of light.</p>

<p>“There they come!” cried Bob. “They’re after
us in the automobile!”</p>

<p>“Ride! Ride fast!” called Maximina, fiercely.
“If they catch us they kill!”</p>

<p>She lashed her pony with the short whip she
carried, and struck Bob’s animal several smart
blows. The two beasts leaped forward.</p>

<p>But horses, especially small, Mexican ponies,
are not built to race against large touring automobiles.
Bob noticed that the chug-chug of Noddy’s
machine came nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can hide from them in the darkness,”
said Bob. “It’s our only chance. They’ll
soon be up to us.”</p>

<p>“No hide! Keep on ride!” exclaimed Maximina.
“We git away!”</p>

<p>But even as she spoke the searchlight picked
them up and they were revealed in its blinding
glare. A faint shout from their pursuers told that
they had been seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The ponies were tiring. Already Bob’s was
staggering along as the pace told on it. Maximina’s
was a little better off.</p>

<p>“We have them!” Bob heard Vasco shout.
“They are both together. Put a little more speed
on, Noddy!”</p>

<p>The chug-chugs of the auto told that the
machine was being sent ahead at a faster
clip. The searchlight glared more strongly on
the fugitives.</p>

<p>“Cave somewhere near here,” said Maximina.
“If we could find ’um we be safe. Ride more,
Bob.”</p>

<p>“This pony can’t go much farther,” replied the
boy. “His legs are shaking now.”</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>A flash of reddish fire cut the blackness, and a
bullet sang unpleasantly close over Bob’s head.</p>

<p>“They only shoot to scare!” cried Maximina.
“They no want to kill you. Too valuable. Want
ransom; much money; ten thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“All the same, it’s no fun to be shot at,” remarked
Bob, urging his pony on.</p>

<p>The automobile was now but a few hundred
feet away. Noddy had to reduce his speed because
the ground was getting rougher.</p>

<p>“We’ll have them in another minute!” cried
Vasco.</p>

<p>At that instant, Bob’s pony, stepping in a hole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
stumbled and fell, throwing the rider over its back.
Bob struck the ground heavily and was stunned.</p>

<p>“Me stay with you!” exclaimed Maximina, reining
in her pony and coming back to where
Bob was.</p>

<p>“No, no! You ride on!” the boy said, faintly.
“Maybe you can find my friends and send help.
They are in the underground city!”</p>

<p>“All right. Me go! Bring help!” the girl
whispered, and, leaping on her pony’s back, she
rode off to one side, getting away from the glare
of the searchlight and so escaping observation.</p>

<p>Two minutes later the auto came up to where
Bob was stretched out on the ground. Vasco
leaped out before the machine had fairly stopped
and made a grab for Bob.</p>

<p>“The boy is dead!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Dead!” faltered Noddy. He was beginning
to be alarmed over the part he had played.</p>

<p>“Bring a light here!” commanded the Mexican.</p>

<p>Noddy turned the search-lamp on Bob’s prostrate
form. At that the boy opened his eyes. He
had fainted from pain caused by his fall.</p>

<p>“Shamming, eh?” sneered Vasco, striking Bob a
blow with a rope he carried. “Get up, now! No
nonsense; you’ve made trouble enough!”</p>

<p>Poor Bob was too discouraged and felt too bad
to reply. The other Mexicans rode up. In a few
minutes the captive was securely bound, lifted into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the auto, and, as dawn broke, the start back to
camp was made.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want Maximina?” asked Dalsett.</p>

<p>“Let her go,” replied Vasco. “She was only a
bother around, and never liked to work. She can’t
do any harm.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a><br />
<small>A STRANGE MESSAGE.</small></h2>


<p>The days were full of anxiety for the professor,
Jerry and Ned, who still remained in the ancient
city after Bob had been kidnapped. Every night
they went to bed, hoping some word would be received
by morning, or that the missing one would
return. Every morning they said to each other:</p>

<p>“Well, something will happen to-morrow.”</p>

<p>But nothing happened, and, as day after day
went by, they began to lose hope.</p>

<p>“We may as well leave here,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” Jerry replied. “I am sure we will
have some word from Bob soon now.”</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, they made trips in all directions
from the ancient city. But there was no trace
of the Mexicans. The country was uninhabited
for twenty miles in every direction from the buried
place, and farther than that the travelers did not
venture.</p>

<p>“We must be here every night,” said the professor.
“Somehow, I feel that Bob will come back at
night, or we will hear something from him after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
dark. So we do not want to be away then, for if
he should come, or if he should send some word,
we would not be here to receive it.”</p>

<p>For that reason little was done toward hunting
for the kidnapped boy. The travelers did not go
so far but that they could get back by nightfall.</p>

<p>They explored the city thoroughly and the professor
found many more rare and valuable relics.
His specimen boxes were full to overflowing, but
still he kept searching.</p>

<p>The boys occupied themselves by getting the
meals and attending to the camp, for the naturalist
bothered himself about nothing but his specimens.
They still continued to reside in the old
temple, which they found a comfortable place.</p>

<p>“I wonder what we’ll do when our food gives
out?” asked Ned one day when it was his turn to
get the dinner.</p>

<p>“Why, haven’t we got plenty for several weeks
yet?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“It don’t look so to me,” said Ned, glancing in
the box where the canned stuff was kept.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” remarked Jerry. “There aren’t
any tomatoes left. Did you cook any since yesterday?”</p>

<p>“You cooked yesterday,” retorted Ned. “Were
there any then?”</p>

<p>“Six cans,” said Jerry. “Now there are none
left. I wonder if the professor took any?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“Any what?” asked the naturalist, coming into
the temple just then.</p>

<p>“Tomatoes,” replied Jerry, explaining what he
and Ned had been talking about.</p>

<p>“No; I haven’t touched a can,” said the professor.</p>

<p>“Then some one has, and it isn’t us,” was Ned’s
opinion. “I wonder if there is any one in this
temple but ourselves?”</p>

<p>“Now that you speak of it, I think there is,”
went on the naturalist. “The other night I was
restless and could not sleep well. I was looking
out of the door of our bedroom, into the main
apartment, when I saw something white moving.
At first I thought it was one of you boys, but I
looked over on your cots and saw you both were
sleeping. Then I thought it might be a white monkey,
for I have heard there are such kinds, though
I have never seen any. But when I looked a little
closer I saw that it was a man wrapped in a long,
white serape.</p>

<p>“I didn’t give any alarm, for I was afraid of
waking you boys. But I watched and saw the man
go to our box and take out some cans of provisions.
I meant to speak about it the next morning, but I
forgot it.”</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose it was?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Probably some poor wandering Mexican,” replied
the professor. “He may have happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
along, fallen into the passage leading to this old
city and been half starved until he found our
camp.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to look out, though,” said
Ned. “We have hardly enough left for ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Then we must keep watch to-night,” decided
the professor. “It will not do for us to starve,
though we will share what we have with any one
who is in distress.”</p>

<p>And so, that night, they took turns in mounting
guard. None of them saw anything out of the
ordinary, though had they been able to witness a
scene that took place in an obscure gallery of the
temple they would have been surprised.</p>

<p>San Lucia and Murado were still hiding in the
place, waiting their chance to get something of
value from the travelers. The capture of Bob had
upset the plans of the two aged brigands, and they
were a little cautious about proceeding. But for
several nights they had made raids on the improvised
pantry Ned had constructed.</p>

<p>“Are we to go again to-night?” asked San Lucia,
on the evening when Ned made the discovery that
led to the posting of the guard.</p>

<p>“It remains to be seen,” replied Murado. “If
we have no better luck than last night it is of little
use.”</p>

<p>“No; tomatoes are a poor substitute for gold,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
agreed San Lucia. “I wonder if they have nothing
but things to eat in those cans.”</p>

<p>“Some of them must contain gold,” replied Murado.
“They do it to fool us, but we will get the
best of them yet. We will carry off every can
they have until we get those containing the treasure.”</p>

<p>For the two Mexicans believed that the travelers
had packed their gold in the tin cans, of which
there was a number. And each night San Lucia
and Murado had stolen a few, hoping that some
of them contained gold. Each time, on opening
the tins, they had been disappointed.</p>

<p>“I will go first to-night,” said San Lucia. “I
feel that I will be successful. Once we get the
gold we can leave this place.”</p>

<p>About midnight he crept as softly as a cat upon
the travelers. But, to his surprise, he found Jerry
on guard and armed. San Lucia sneaked back to
the balcony and told Murado.</p>

<p>“They are becoming suspicious,” said the latter.
“We will have to wait a while. Perhaps they may
be sleeping to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>But the two aged brigands never got another
chance to attempt to rob the boys and the professor.
Why this was we shall soon see.</p>

<p>The next morning, on account of the watch
that was kept, nothing was found disturbed.</p>

<p>“We fooled somebody that time,” observed Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>After breakfast the professor announced that he
was going to visit the house where he had, on a
previous call, captured the gila monster.</p>

<p>“There was a cabinet there I overlooked,” he
said. “Do you boys want to come along?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing else to do,” said Jerry. “How
I wish we would hear something from Bob! I
think we ought to go out on a search for him. It
doesn’t seem that he will ever come here, after all
this time.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking that myself,” said the professor.
“If we hear nothing by to-morrow we will leave
this place.”</p>

<p>The boys accompanied the naturalist to the
ruined house. It seemed strange to be walking
through the streets of a place that had been inhabited
thousands of years ago. The city was a
silent one, a veritable city of the dead, and the
houses and buildings seemed like tombstones that
had toppled over from age.</p>

<p>As Ned was walking about through the lower
rooms of the house the professor had marked for
exploration, he noticed a ring fastened to a square
stone in the courtyard.</p>

<p>“I wonder what this is for?” he said.</p>

<p>“Looks as if it was meant to lift the stone up
by,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“Give us a hand,” said Ned, “and we’ll see
what’s here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The two boys pulled and tugged, but could not
budge the stone. The professor happened along
and saw them.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you how to do it,” he said.</p>

<p>He took a long pole and thrust it through the
ring. Then, using the pole as a lever, he easily
raised the stone.</p>

<p>“Now let’s see what we have unearthed,” he remarked.</p>

<p>The stone had covered a small hole. In it
was a little casket of lead, the lid of which was
locked.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to break it open,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Get a stone,” put in Ned.</p>

<p>Jerry brought a large one. One or two heavy
blows and the lid of the box flew off. There was a
sudden sparkle of light and several white objects
fell to the ground.</p>

<p>“Diamonds!” cried the professor. “We have
made a valuable discovery!”</p>

<p>The box seemed full of jewels. There were
stones of many colors, but most of all were the
white, sparkling ones.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re only glass,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“No; they are diamonds, rubies, turquoise and
other precious stones,” replied the professor. “This
was probably the jewel case of some Aztec millionaire.”</p>

<p>They returned to their camp, carrying the jewels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
with them. As they entered the old building,
Jerry, who was in the lead, started back.</p>

<p>“There’s some one at our auto!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” replied the professor. “The place
is deserted.”</p>

<p>But he changed his mind a moment later. As he
entered the room he saw a girlish figure clinging
to the side of the car. She seemed to be almost
dead, and had only strength enough left to mutter:</p>

<p>“Bob; he want you! Vasco Bilette have him!
Come quick!”</p>

<p>Then she fell over in a faint.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a><br />
<small>TO THE RESCUE.</small></h2>


<p>“Who is she?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the professor, calmly.
He seemed to take the appearance of a strange girl
in the underground city as a happening that might
occur at any time.</p>

<p>“Where did she come from?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you that, either,” went on the naturalist.
“One thing I can say, though, and that
is, this poor girl needs help. She must be hungry,
and she has traveled a long distance. Her clothes
show that.”</p>

<p>“What did she mean by speaking about Bob,
saying Vasco Bilette had him, and for us to come
quick?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“All that in good time,” replied the professor.
“The thing to do now is to bring her out of her
faint, and get her something to eat. Ned, you
make the coffee and Jerry will heat some chicken
soup. Hurry now, boys.”</p>

<p>But the lads needed no urging. In a jiffy the
camp-stove was going and hot coffee was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
ready. In the meanwhile the professor, by use of
some simple remedies he always carried, brought
the girl out of her faint. She opened her eyes and
asked for a drink.</p>

<p>The hot coffee, followed by a little of the warm
soup, brought the color back to her face, and she
was able to sit up. She stared at her strange surroundings
and looked at the boys and the naturalist.</p>

<p>“Me Maximina,” she said, speaking slowly.
“You Ned, Jerry and Mr. Snowgrass?”</p>

<p>“Snodgrass, Snodgrass, my dear young lady,”
replied the professor, bowing low. “Professor
Uriah Snodgrass, A. M., Ph.D., M. D., F. R.
G. S., A. Q. K., all of which is at your service.”</p>

<p>“Bob need you,” said the girl, simply. “He try
to come, but he git ketch.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! Tell us about him. Where can we
find him?” asked Jerry, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Me no spik Inglis good,” the girl replied. “You
spik Spanish, señor?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Si</i>,” answered the professor.</p>

<p>Thereupon Maximina let forth a torrent of
words that nearly overwhelmed the naturalist.
Yet he managed to understand what she said.</p>

<p>Maximina told how she had been at the Mexicans’
camp when Bob was brought there, she having
been a captive for many years. She determined
to help him escape, and did so when the opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
offered. She told how she knew, in a general
way, where the buried city was, as Bob had
told her something about it, and she had overheard
Vasco and his men talking about the locality where
they had fallen down the tunnel.</p>

<p>“But Bob’s horse fell and threw him off,” she
explained, in her native tongue. “I wanted to stay
with him, but he told me to go on. Then Vasco
came and got him, but I rode away, for I wanted
to find you. I had hard work, and I lost my way
several times. Three days ago my pony died and
I walked the rest of the distance.”</p>

<p>“Poor girl! You must be almost tired to death,”
said the professor.</p>

<p>“I was tired, but it is happiness to find you,
señors, for I know you will go and help Señor
Bob.”</p>

<p>“Of course we will, right away,” said the naturalist.</p>

<p>“She seems to have taken a sudden liking to our
friend Bob,” commented Ned. “She’s a mighty
pretty girl, too; don’t you think so, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Be careful,” laughed Jerry. “Don’t go to having
any love affairs with beautiful Mexican maidens.
I have read that they are a very jealous and
quick-tempered nation. Besides, you are too
young.”</p>

<p>“I’m a year older than Bob,” maintained Ned.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, what had we better do?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the professor. “Maximina can guide us to the
place where Bob is held captive. Shall we go and
give battle to these brigands?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” exclaimed Ned. “We have plenty of
ammunition.”</p>

<p>“And they are about ten to our one,” put in
Jerry. “But we’ve got to do something,” he
added, seriously.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll start as soon as we can get in shape,”
decided the professor. “I have a better plan than
making a direct attack on the camp of the Mexicans,
however. We will go to the authorities and
ask their aid. Maximina says there is a detachment
of soldiers stationed about thirty miles from
here and on the line we must take to go to the
camp, from which they are distant about ten
miles.”</p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Ned. “With a few soldiers
to help us we’ll give those brigands and
Noddy Nixon such a licking that they’ll never
want another.”</p>

<p>The automobile was soon made ready. In it was
packed all that remained of the provisions. The
professor did up his precious specimens and curios,
not forgetting the lead casket of jewels.</p>

<p>The water tank was filled. Fortunately, there
was still plenty of gasolene left. Jerry and Ned
pumped up the tires, Maximina was invited to a
seat in the rear, with the professor, and the travelers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
taking a last look at the underground city,
started off.</p>

<p>They went through the tunnel, up the incline, the
fall of which had precipitated them into the shaft,
and soon were on the level road, speeding to the
rescue of Bob.</p>

<p>After Vasco had secured his captive, following
Bob’s and Maximina’s flight, the brigand took
measures to insure that the prisoner would not get
away again. Bob was placed in a regular dungeon,
and outside the door was stationed a man
with a gun.</p>

<p>The poor lad was in low spirits. He began to
give up hope, and the only thing that cheered him
was the thought that perhaps Maximina might
have gotten away and would notify his friends or
the authorities.</p>

<p>But Bob knew it was a remote chance, for he
did not believe the frail girl could stand the long
journey alone. He tried to learn something about
her; whether she had been recaptured or not; but
to all questions his guard, and the old woman who
brought him food, returned but one answer, and
that was:</p>

<p>“No spik Inglis, señor.”</p>

<p>Bob saw it was of no use to try to get out of the
dungeon. It was built partially underground, the
walls were of stone and the door a massive wooden
one, while the single window was heavily barred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
It was hot in the small cell, and Bob suffered very
much. But he tried to keep up a brave heart.</p>

<p>One day he heard voices outside of the dungeon
window. He listened intently and found that
Noddy and Vasco were talking. Vasco, of necessity,
had to speak English in talking with Noddy,
who understood only a little Spanish.</p>

<p>“Have you got the money yet?” asked Noddy.</p>

<p>“No; and I think we never will get it,” replied
Vasco, angrily. “I don’t believe the boy is the
son of a rich banker at all. It’s another one of
your wild dreams, just like the gold mine the crazy
professor was going to locate.”</p>

<p>“Bob’s father is rich,” maintained Noddy. “It
ain’t my fault that he won’t send the cash.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s your fault for getting me into this
muss,” went on Vasco, “and it’ll be your fault if we
don’t get some money pretty soon. The men are
mad and I won’t be able to manage ’em in a few
days. They blame it all on you, so you’d better
look out!”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they&mdash;they will ki-kill me?”
faltered Noddy.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised,” said Vasco, coldly.</p>

<p>At that instant Bob heard some one come galloping
up on a horse. It seemed to be a messenger,
for he heard the steed come to a stop, while
a man jumped down and began talking rapidly
in Spanish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it? Has Bob’s father sent the
money?” asked Noddy.</p>

<p>“Money? No!” snapped the leader of the
brigands. “But the soldiers are after us! We
must get out of here!”</p>

<p>Bob’s heart thrilled with hope. Perhaps, after
all, Maximina had been able to send help. He
almost laughed in his happiness, thinking he would
soon be free.</p>

<p>But his hopes were dashed to the ground when,
a few minutes later, his guard came into his cell,
quickly bound his hands and feet, wrapped a long
cloak about him, and, with the aid of another Mexican,
carried him out of the cell.</p>

<p>Bob realized, from the change of air, that he
was being carried into the open. He could see
nothing because of the cloak about his head, but
he could hear much bustle and confusion.</p>

<p>Men were running here and there, while Vasco
was giving quick orders. Then the sound of the
automobile being started was heard. Bob felt himself
lifted into the car and, a few seconds later, he
felt the vibration that told he was being carried
away again, this time in Noddy’s machine.</p>

<p>As the messenger had told Vasco, the soldiers
were on their way to the camp of the kidnappers.
The boys and the professor had reached the garrison,
and, telling their story, had induced the commander
to send a detachment to capture the Mexicans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
But the troops traveled slowly, and one of
Vasco’s friends, who happened to be hanging about
the fort, hearing of the contemplated raid,
mounted a swift horse and rode off to give the
alarm.</p>

<p>So when, a few hours after Vasco had fled with
his men and his captive, the troops galloped up, led
by Jerry, Ned, Maximina and the professor in the
automobile, they found the camp deserted.</p>

<p>“The birds have flown!” exclaimed the captain
of the troopers. “We may as well go back!”</p>

<p>“No!” cried Jerry. “We must take after them.
Bob must be rescued!”</p>

<p>“But how can we tell where they went?” asked
the captain.</p>

<p>“That woman can tell you!” exclaimed Maximina,
pointing to an aged crone who was trying to
escape observation in one of the huts.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a><br />
<small>THE FIGHT.</small></h2>


<p>“Bring her here!” commanded the captain.</p>

<p>Several of his soldiers ran toward the old woman
who set up a loud screaming.</p>

<p>“Who is she?” asked the leader of the troops of
Maximina.</p>

<p>“An old servant of Vasco’s,” replied the girl.
“She knows all his secrets and can tell where he
has gone. He has several hiding places about
here.”</p>

<p>Protesting and crying that she knew nothing and
could tell nothing, the aged servant was brought
to the captain.</p>

<p>“Where is Vasco Bilette?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I know not! I have not seen him these three
days!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“So,” commented the captain, smiling. “We
will see if we cannot refresh your memory. Pedro,
fetch my rawhide whip!”</p>

<p>At this the woman howled most dismally, and
threw herself on the ground, clinging to the legs
of the men who held her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“I cannot allow this,” interposed Professor
Snodgrass, to whom the conversation, carried on in
Spanish, was intelligible. “Even at the cost of
seeing Vasco Bilette escape I will not stand by and
see a woman whipped.”</p>

<p>“But, señor, you do not understand the case,”
said the captain. “That is the only way I can get
the truth out of her. I must give her a few blows
to loosen her tongue. That is the only persuasion
these cattle understand; blows and money.”</p>

<p>“Why not try the latter?” suggested the naturalist.</p>

<p>“Who has money to throw away on such as
she?” asked the commander, with a shrug of his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“I will pay her,” went on the professor. “See,”
he went on, taking out some bank-notes. “Tell us
where Vasco went and you shall have fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>The old woman glanced at the money, looked
around on the soldiers and glared at the captain,
who was switching a cruel whip. Then she said,
sullenly:</p>

<p>“I will tell you, señor, but not for money. It
is because you had a kind thought for old Julia.
Listen, Vasco has gone to the cave by the small
mountain.”</p>

<p>“I know where that is!” exclaimed the captain.
“Many a time have we had fights there with the
brigands. It is about ten miles off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then let us hurry there!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>The professor handed the old woman the bills.
She took them, hiding them quickly in her dress.</p>

<p>“The whip would have been cheaper,” said the
captain, with a regretful sigh. “It is money
thrown away.”</p>

<p>“I have more to throw after it, if you and your
men rescue the kidnapped boy!” exclaimed the naturalist,
for he understood something of the Mexican
character.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried the captain. “Come, men,
hurry! We will wipe the brigands from the face
of the earth!”</p>

<p>Indeed, new enthusiasm seemed to be infused
into the soldiers at the mention of money. Those
who had dismounted, sprang quickly to the saddles,
the bugler blew a lively air, and the troops started
off at a smart trot. Old Julia was left behind in
the camp of the kidnappers.</p>

<p>The boys and the professor, with Maximina, in
the automobile, followed the troopers.</p>

<p>“I think there will be one big fight,” said the
girl, in English, speaking to the boys. “Vasco has
many guns in the cave.”</p>

<p>“I hope it will be his last fight,” said Ned. “I
don’t wish any one bad luck, but I would like to
see Vasco Bilette and his gang put where they can
do no more harm.”</p>

<p>“The soldiers don’t seem to take this very seriously,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
remarked Jerry. “Hear them singing and
laughing.”</p>

<p>“They probably want Vasco to know they are
coming, so they will not take him by surprise,”
spoke the professor. “It’s a trait of Mexican politeness,
I suppose.”</p>

<p>The captain of the troop came riding back to the
automobile, which had kept in the rear of the horsemen.</p>

<p>“My compliments, señor,” said the commander,
bowing with a sweep of his helmet to the professor.</p>

<p>“My best regards to you,” replied the naturalist.</p>

<p>“We will be up to the vicinity of the cave in
about an hour,” went on the captain. “Is it your
desire to charge in the fire-wagon with my troopers,
or do you prefer to stay in the rear and watch us
dispose of this brigand?”</p>

<p>“We’re not the ones to stay in the rear when
there’s fighting to be done,” said the professor.
“You will find us in the fore, Señor Captain.”</p>

<p>“Very good; but what about the girl?”</p>

<p>“I will stay with my friends,” replied Maximina.
“I am not afraid of Vasco Bilette.”</p>

<p>“You may stay with us,” consented the naturalist,
“but I must insist on you getting down on the
bottom of the car when the fighting begins.”</p>

<p>“Fighting? There will be no fighting,” said
the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to tackle the brigands and
get Bob?” asked Jerry, in some surprise.</p>

<p>“<em lang="es" xml:lang="es">Caramba!</em> The dogs will run when they see
my troops,” spoke the captain, puffing out his chest.
“They will not stand. That is why I said there
would be no fighting.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be too sure,” remarked the professor.</p>

<p>“You shall see, señor,” went on the commander.
“But now I must go back to my men. My compliments,
señor.”</p>

<p>“Mine to you,” responded the professor, not
to be outdone in politeness.</p>

<p>The cavalcade moved forward for several miles.
It was getting hot and horses and men began to
suffer. It was a relief when a small stream was
reached, where every one could get a refreshing
drink. After a short rest the command to move
forward was given.</p>

<p>“What is that?” cried Jerry, suddenly, pointing
ahead to where, on a broad, level stretch of country,
several small, dark, moving objects could be
seen.</p>

<p>“I will tell you directly,” said the professor,
taking a pair of field-glasses from their case. He
leveled the binoculars and gazed steadily through
them.</p>

<p>“It is Vasco and his party!” he cried. “I can
see Noddy in his auto, and there are a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
horsemen. They have not yet reached the cave.
Quick, Jerry, run the machine ahead and tell the
captain!”</p>

<p>Jerry increased the speed of the auto. It ran
up beside the trooper captain, who turned about to
see what was up.</p>

<p>“There are the brigands!” exclaimed the professor,
pointing ahead. “Hurry up and you can catch
them before they get to the cave, where they may
barricade themselves.”</p>

<p>“My compliments, señor; I thank you for the
information,” replied the captain, bowing low.
“Will you not smoke a cigarette with me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t smoke!” snapped the professor. “Besides,
we have no time for that now. We must
fight!”</p>

<p>“Exactly, just so,” answered the easy-going
Mexican. “Come, men!” he exclaimed. “The
enemy is in front of you! At them, and show what
stuff you are made of! Bugler, sound the charge!”</p>

<p>Instantly the troops were full of excitement.
Men began unslinging their carbines. They got
out their ammunition and seemed eager for the
fray. The bugler blew a merry blast.</p>

<p>“Forward, my brave men! Cut down the brigands!
Kill the kidnappers of boys!” shouted the
captain, waving his sword.</p>

<p>With a shout, the Mexican soldiers dashed forward
to the fight. They might be slow, and given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to too much delay and politeness, but when the time
came they were full of action.</p>

<p>They yelled as they dug spurs into their horses,
and the more excited threw their hats into the air.
Several discharged their carbines when there was
no chance of hitting any of the enemy. They were
wild at the thought of battle.</p>

<p>By this time the brigands became aware of the
pursuit. Vasco Bilette had, with a powerful field-glass,
detected the advance of the horsemen some
time back. But an accident to the auto had detained
them, and they were three miles from the
cave when he saw the soldiers dashing toward him.</p>

<p>He and his men strained every nerve, but they
soon saw they could not get to their stronghold
ahead of their enemies.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to fight ’em,” said Vasco. “I guess
we can give ’em as good as they send. Noddy and
Dalsett, you keep an eye on Bob, and if you get a
chance, skip off with him. Go back to camp; they
won’t think of looking for you there.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the soldiers were within shooting
distance. They opened fire on the Mexicans,
who, not daunted by the numbers against them, returned
the volleys. At first so great was the excitement
that no damage was done. But after a
few rounds two of the troopers were injured, and
one of the Mexicans had to withdraw, seriously
wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“We must never surrender!” cried Vasco.</p>

<p>“Exterminate the brigands!” shouted the soldiers.</p>

<p>They came to closer quarters. The soldiers
began to use their carbines for clubs, not taking
the time to reload. Then they drew their sabres
and charged the Mexicans under Vasco, who had
drawn his force up in a hollow square. Several on
both sides were killed in this mêlée.</p>

<p>The boys and the professor, who, under the
captain’s later orders, had kept to the rear, now
came dashing up in the automobile. Maximina
was lying down on the floor of the tonneau, out of
harm’s way.</p>

<p>Jerry was keeping an eye on Noddy and his
auto, and he noticed that the machine, which, as
he could see plainly now, held Bob, kept well behind
the brigands.</p>

<p>“We must get Bob, no matter what happens,”
said Jerry to Ned. “Look sharp now. I’m going
to try something.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Just you watch!” exclaimed Jerry. “Look
out!”</p>

<p>He ducked, to avoid a bullet that sang over his
head.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of doing that?” asked Ned.
“The bullet is past when you hear it sing.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The fighting was now at its height. Though the
force on both sides was small, the guns kept up a
continuous fusillade, and it sounded as though a
good-sized detachment was going into action.</p>

<p>“No quarter! Not a man must escape!” cried
the captain.</p>

<p>“Charge!” yelled Vasco Bilette, trying to urge
his men to make a rush and overwhelm the soldiers.
“Charge and the day is won!”</p>

<p>With a shout, his men prepared to obey his command.</p>

<p>“Now is your chance!” whispered the brigand
leader to Noddy. “Away with Bob!”</p>

<p>Noddy headed the machine, containing the
bound captive, off to one side.</p>

<p>“There he goes!” Jerry shouted, catching sight
of the movement. “We must take after him, Ned.
Noddy has Bob with him.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a><br />
<small>HOMEWARD BOUND.</small></h2>


<p>Steering to one side, to avoid running into the
mass of men, soldiers and kidnappers that seemed
to be mixed up in inextricable confusion, Jerry sent
his machine after Noddy’s, which was speeding
away.</p>

<p>“Shall I try a shot at the tires?” asked Ned,
fingering his revolver.</p>

<p>“No; you might hit Bob,” replied Jerry. “I’ll
catch him.”</p>

<p>The battle was now divided. On one side the
soldiers and the Mexicans were fighting. On the
other was the race between the two autos; a contest
of machinery.</p>

<p>At first it seemed that Noddy would escape. But
Jerry, throwing in the high-speed clutch, cut down
the distance between his car and Noddy’s. A few
minutes after the chase started it became evident
that Jerry would win.</p>

<p>Vasco, seeing how matters were likely to go,
had jumped into the car as Noddy started off. All
this while poor Bob was bound, and the cloak was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
still about his head, so he could not tell what was
going on. But he guessed it was some attempt to
rescue him.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came Jerry’s auto. The front
wheels overlapped the rear ones of Noddy’s machine.</p>

<p>“Stop, or I’ll fire!” cried the professor, suddenly,
leveling a revolver at Noddy’s crowd. They
paid no heed to him.</p>

<p>With a quick motion, Vasco leaned over the
edge of the seat and fired three times in rapid succession
at the tires of Jerry’s machine. He missed
his aim, but Jerry saw the danger that threatened
him. He increased his speed.</p>

<p>In another minute he had come up alongside of
Noddy’s auto.</p>

<p>“Get ready to grab Bob!” Jerry yelled to Ned
and the professor. “Then hold on tight!”</p>

<p>“I’ll pay you for this!” exclaimed Vasco, fiercely.
He leaned over the edge of the car and made a
vicious lunge at Jerry with a long knife. Jerry
swerved his machine the least bit and avoided the
blow.</p>

<p>The next instant the autos came together with a
crash. The shock threw Vasco out, for he was already
leaning more than half way over the side
door, in an endeavor to strike at Jerry. The wheels
of the heavy machine passed over his legs, making
him a cripple for life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing how matters were likely to turn out,
Noddy shut off the power and brought his machine
to a stop. Ned and the professor took advantage
of this to reach over and grab Bob.</p>

<p>“Now we haf rescue him!” exclaimed Maximina.
“I knew we would haf found Bob!” and
she laughed and cried by turns.</p>

<p>It did not take long to loosen the captive’s bonds.
The suffocating shawl was taken from his head.
Poor Bob was faint and white.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon fix him up!” cried the professor,
cheerily. “Run to one side, Jerry.”</p>

<p>Leaving the discomfited Noddy and his chum,
Jack Pender, Jerry steered off under a clump of
trees, where, by the administrations of the professor,
Bob was soon himself again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the battle between the brigands and
the troops was waging furiously. Several had
fallen on both sides, but the better-trained soldiers
knew more about warfare, and slowly but surely
they pressed their enemies back.</p>

<p>Then, when Vasco fell and was crushed by the
auto, the men lost heart. They faltered, wavered
and then turned and fled.</p>

<p>Dalsett endeavored to rally them. He caught
hold of some of the brigands and urged them to
stand against the charge of the soldiers. One
of the kidnappers resented Dalsett’s interference.
With a wild cry he plunged a knife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
into the former miner, and Dalsett fell, seriously
wounded.</p>

<p>“They fly! They fly! Take after them!” cried
the captain of the troopers. “At them, my brave
men! Hew them down! Wipe them off the face
of the earth!”</p>

<p>It was noticeable that as the tide turned in favor
of the soldiers their leader became more bold. He
rode hither and thither, waving his sword, but taking
care not to get too far to the front.</p>

<p>At length, with a last volley, the brigands fled.
The troopers took after them, killing several and
wounding some. They chased them until the kidnappers
came to the foothills, and, as this was a
wild country, the troopers did not care to follow.
So some of the brigands escaped. But the band
was broken up and for many years thereafter no
trouble was experienced with them.</p>

<p>Noddy had not started up his machine after
Vasco had been knocked from it. The former
bully seemed to be in a sort of daze, and he and
Pender sat staring at the exciting scenes going on
all about them.</p>

<p>When Bob had been made comfortable on a
bed of blankets spread under the trees, Jerry
thought of their former enemy.</p>

<p>“What had we better do about Noddy?” he
asked of the professor. “There he sits in his machine.
Shall we turn him over to the soldiers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know but what it would be a good
idea,” said the naturalist. “Just have an eye to
him for a few minutes, anyhow. The captain will
be here in a little while, and he’ll decide what to do.
I suppose the law must take its course.”</p>

<p>Seeing that Bob was doing very well under the
care of Maximina and the professor, Ned and
Jerry ran their machine over to where Noddy was.</p>

<p>“Don’t give me up!” pleaded Nixon. “I didn’t
mean to do any harm. It was all Dalsett and
Vasco. See, here is your money-belt, Jerry. I
never touched a cent of it.”</p>

<p>“So it was you who took it, eh?” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;I didn’t steal it. Dalsett made me
take it that night,” faltered Noddy. “But I never
took any money out of it. I used my own. Please
let me go!”</p>

<p>“You are a prisoner of the captain, not one of
ours,” replied Jerry. “He’ll have to settle your
case.”</p>

<p>At that instant the captain, who, with his men,
had ridden to where Vasco was stretched out on the
ground, called to Jerry and Ned. They turned the
machine toward him.</p>

<p>The professor, too, came running over. The
captain spoke some command to one of his men,
who began a search of the clothing of the kidnapper
leader.</p>

<p>“Ha! There is something!” exclaimed the captain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
as his man hauled two money-belts out of
Vasco’s pocket. “I wonder whom they belong to?”</p>

<p>“One’s mine!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“And the other is Bob’s,” said Jerry. “I wonder
if there is any money left in them?”</p>

<p>“Look,” said the captain, passing them over.
The boys and the professor, who had translated the
captain’s remarks as he had made them, looked
over the articles. They found that about half the
sum in each belt had been spent.</p>

<p>“Well, half a loaf is better than no bread,” remarked
Jerry. “We ought to be thankful we’re
alive, to say nothing of getting part of our cash
back.”</p>

<p>“You all seem to have plenty of money;
you are not like the poor Mexicans,” said
the captain, with a sigh, looking at the professor,
meaningly.</p>

<p>“That reminds me: I promised to reward you
and your men if we were successful,” spoke the naturalist.</p>

<p>He distributed a good-sized sum among the soldiers,
who seemed very pleased to get it. Their
salaries under the government were small, and not
always paid regularly, so that any addition was welcome.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the captain, suddenly, as
he shoved his share of the distribution in his
pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s Noddy and Pender in their auto,” said
Jerry. “They are going to escape.”</p>

<p>“Shall we fire at them?” asked the captain, eagerly.</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” asked Jerry. “Let them go.
We would only have more bother if we tried to
get them punished by law for their crimes. We
have Bob back, we discovered the underground
city, and what more do we want?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, excepting to get back home,” put in
Ned. “I’ll be glad to see Cresville again.”</p>

<p>So no attempt was made to capture Noddy and
his chum, and they sped off across-country in their
machine, running at top speed, as if they feared
pursuit. Bill Berry, slightly wounded, went with
them.</p>

<p>“Is there anything more we can do for you?”
asked the captain. “If there is not we will start
back to the garrison, as it is growing late.”</p>

<p>The professor said he thought they could
dispense with the services of the troops. So,
amid a chorus of good-byes, the horsemen rode
away.</p>

<p>“Well, here we are, all together once more,”
observed the professor.</p>

<p>“And with an addition to our party,” put in Ned,
pointing to Maximina.</p>

<p>“That’s so; we must get her back home next,”
the professor said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“First, give me something to eat and drink,”
begged Bob. “I’m almost starved.”</p>

<p>It was so near night that the travelers decided
to make a camp. Supper was soon ready, and
after it had been disposed of, the boys made a small
tent out of blankets for Maximina.</p>

<p>The next morning they started northward.
Maximina had told them she had relatives in the
City of Mexico, and they headed for that place.
They reached it, without having any accidents, a
week later, and left the girl who had befriended
Bob with her friends.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we’ll have any more adventures?”
said Ned, as, after a few days’ rest, they started
from the City of Mexico toward home.</p>

<p>“Hard to say, but probably you boys will,” said
the professor. “Boys are always having adventures.
As for me, I am satisfied with those we
had on this trip. We had the most excellent success.
My name will be famous when the story of
the underground city is told in four large volumes
which I intend to issue.”</p>

<p>“I would think it might,” commented Ned.
“Four books are enough to make any one
famous.”</p>

<p>“Well, it will take some long letters to tell our
folks of all that has happened to us,” put in Bob.
Telegrams had already been sent, so that nobody
at home might worry further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll be glad enough to get back to the States,”
said Jerry. “Mexico is not the best place in the
world.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we’ll have more adventures before
long,” was Ned’s comment, and he was right. What
those adventures were will be told in the next volume
of this series, to be called “The Motor Boys
Across the Plains; or, The Hermit of Lost Lake.”
Here we shall meet all of our young friends again,
and also some of their enemies, and learn much
concerning a most peculiar mystery.</p>

<p>The weather remained fine, and as the auto had
been thoroughly repaired in the City of Mexico
before leaving, rapid progress was made in the
journey northward. They kept, as far as possible,
to the best and most frequented roads, having no
desire to meet any more brigands.</p>

<p>“Tell you what,” said Bob, one day, “automobiling
is great, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Immense!” answered Ned.</p>

<p>“It’s the best sport going,” added Jerry. “I love
this touring car of ours as I would love a brother.”</p>

<p>And then he put on a burst of speed that soon
took them around a bend of the road and out of
sight&mdash;and also out of my story.</p>

<p class="p2">Ever since the success of Mr. Chadwick’s
“College Sports Series” we have been urged
to get him to write a series dealing exclusively
with baseball, a subject in which he is unexcelled
by any living American author or coach.</p>


<p class="noi adauthor">Baseball Joe of the Silver Stars<br />
<small>or The Rivals of Riverside</small></p>

<p>In this volume, the first of the series, Joe is introduced as an everyday
country boy who loves to play baseball and is particularly anxious to
make his mark as a pitcher. He finds it almost impossible to get on
the local nine, but, after a struggle, he succeeds. A splendid picture
of the great national game in the smaller towns of our country.</p>


<p class="noi adauthor">Baseball Joe on the School Nine<br />
<small>or Pitching for the Blue Banner</small></p>

<p>Joe’s great ambition was to go to boarding school and play on the
school team. He got to boarding school but found it harder making
the team there than it was getting on the nine at home. He fought
his way along, and at last saw his chance and took it, and made good.</p>


<p class="noi adauthor">Baseball Joe at Yale<br />
<small>or Pitching for the College Championship</small></p>

<p>From a preparatory school Baseball Joe goes to Yale University.
He makes the freshman nine and in his second year becomes a varsity
pitcher and pitches in several big games.</p>


<p class="noi adauthor">Baseball Joe in the Central League<br />
<small>or Making Good as a Professional Pitcher</small></p>

<p>In this volume the scene of action is shifted from Yale College to a
baseball league of our central states. Baseball Joe’s work in the box
for Old Eli had been noted by one of the managers and Joe gets an offer
he cannot resist. The book shows how the hero “made good” in
more ways than one, helping a down-and-out player back to the right path
as well as doing his share to win some great victories on the diamond.</p>
